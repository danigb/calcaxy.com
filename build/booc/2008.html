	<p>thanks a lot Rudolf Frieling and his team (Melissa, Tammy, Frederic, 
Steven, andandand..) to have enabled us this experience! as (almost) 
always we miss the link to the outside space, the participation of the 
local and the locals &#8211; but we understand that this was not easy to create 
in this context, and hope that this is only a first collaboration-step for 
c a l c and San Francisco.</p>

	<p>we have some good projects in the drawer..and want to send Rudolf 
the project outlines. all four project want to be realized in collaboration 
with this city and with people we would like to find here! artists.
activists. scientists.</p>

	<p>why here and not in Seville or elsewhere? because we think that we can 
find these partners here.. the four projects are in the drawer because we 
gave up finding them there..</p>


	<p>soon we&#8217;l let you know!</p>

hanging the first results of the ballots counted so far:</p>


	<p><img src="/files/xymedia/0000/1049/votetotalasreport.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>..we all knew that this neighbourhood will vOte like this, no
surprise. actually the whole result was not suprising.. looking
back at our perceptions and feelings.. but there was also the
feeling of fear &#8211; that people don&#8217;t go vote.. that some O-man
turn out being Mc-C-man when they are all alone in the cabin..
but nO! the O was rounded this night, welcome to the new
era! gOd knows how Obama and his team can face and solve
the mountain of problems Bush leaves them. nothing won&#8217;t be 
as we wish it to be: straight, fast, better.. but everything will be 
on its way towards something more human anyway.. 
how strange: we just said that it is the first time that we have the
honest feeling of trusting a politician.</p>

tomorrow the show in the <span class="caps">MOMA</span> will be opened to the public.. 
malex and omi are going downtown to join the press- conference and 
-preview this morning. Rudolf Frieling does a nice speach.. mentioning
how much he was hOping that the election result would be what it is,
so the &#8220;Art of Participation&#8221; would also throw some light on (t)his show!</p>

we are invited by Pam and Peg and Bruce Brennan to join the
election night at the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1304791/">Westin St.Francis Hotel</a>, Grand Ballroom,
where the democratic party invites to celebrate a democratic
party!</p>


	<p><img src="/files/xymedia/0000/1037/ivoted.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p><strong>I voted</strong> stickers everywhere.. Ben and Jerry gives icecream, Starbucks
gives coffee, the bakery around the corner gives a Waffel..</p>


	<p>as you all already know we made it, the whole democratic world made it!
Barack Obama is the elected president of the United States of America!</p>


	<p><a href="/files/xymedia/0000/1045/Oelected.jpg"><img src="/files/xymedia/0000/1043/Oelected_th.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>


	<p>this is much more a millenium new year party! a mega-hug-event as none
of use ever experienced. omi + Pam had the same feeling: the feeling that
they wanted to cry from joy&#8230;as so many others in the St. Francis this night!
so many tears, so many loughs, so many african-american faces just full up
to tears with joy and confidence. thanks US, we do love you as well!
lets see what will happen nOw! we are looking forward to the exposition preview
tomorrow!</p>


	<p><img src="/files/xymedia/0000/1047/yeswecan.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>after the democratic milleniums new years eve we&#8217;re going to meet the technicians
from the <span class="caps">MOMA</span> at the election party in the <a href="http://www.ybca.org/">Hierba Buena Center for the Arts</a>.. but they all
left already.. so, last dance with oPAMa!</p>

speaks about <img src="/files/xymedia/0000/1021/change.jpg" alt="" />. 
its like the republican party doesn&#8217;t exist any-more.. or doesn&#8217;t know 
anymore which ideology they represent.</p>


	<p>the only image we saw so far, really the only one far and wide,
was this t-shirt in this shop around the corner on Haigh Ashbury:</p>


	<p><a href="/files/xymedia/0000/1019/goodbye.jpg"><img src="/files/xymedia/0000/1017/goodbye_th.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>


	<p>..and today is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Dead">the day of the death</a> &#8211; goodbye death, hello live!
we all are going downtown to Mission street.. to the latino neighbourhood
which we wanted to visit anyway because of its graffity tradition.</p>

	<p>if we look and listen around <span class="caps">ALL</span> indicates that Obama wins..straight
and with a mayoiruty which allows changes, poco a poco, bus although
it seems to be so obvious we all doubt at the same time. Larry King,
the calcies, everybody we ask. aren&#8217;t they more racist when they are
alone in the voting cabin then? what ugly joker may carry this republicans
of change? late this night we see Obama talking in Florida&#8230;&#8221;Florida, I
have two words for you: three days!&#8221;</p>

	<p>by the way &#8211; did you see that the Obama-CHANGE uses the same 
typograpghy than <span class="caps">CHANEL</span>? do think thats a coincidence? when omi and
Pam recognized that the first time, they were sure it isn&#8217;t, even the distance
between the letters are the same! it makes a subconscious link to what we 
are associating with elegance, beauty, &#8220;smells good&#8221;.. come on <span class="caps">CHANGE</span> #5!
Pam and omi want to do a graphic work with this observation..</p></div>

in the evening. after a long trip from Zurich via <span class="caps">NYC</span> they feel
tired and happy to be here and jump to bed right after a dinner
at <a href="http://www.magnoliapub.com/">Magnolias</a>.</p>


	<p>the next day omi and mali are going downtown to the <span class="caps">MOMA</span>
to meet Rudolf Frieling, the curator of <em>&#8220;The Art of Participation&#8221;</em>
and to see how the insallation of the big print of communimage
goes.</p>

	<p>goes quite well&#8230; allthough we wouldn&#8217;t agree again on printing the image on
Sintra (a kind of plastic), because it is nearly impossible to mount the single
tiles precisely and because the print became a bit blurry by using this technic.
next time we&#8217;d do it on paper again; also because that makes clearer that the
project is not about this fixed image, but about how this image is growing..</p></div>
