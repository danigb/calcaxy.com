	<p>Estimad@s amig@s</p>


	<p>Os comunico la finalización de la 4ª etapa del <span class="caps">WRC</span> (World Routers Challenge)entre Buenos Aires y Fortaleza.
Para nosotros, VskTugas I, resultó muy complicada, un error de calculo nos dejó a media regata en la posición 104 o alrededores desde la cual y no con poco esfuerzo conseguimos remontar hasta la 8ª en la línea de meta, con este resultado y los de los rivales, seguimos conservando la 1ª posición de la clasificación del Campeonato con 34 puntos de ventaja sobre el 2º.
Os aseguro que en la próxima etapa Fortaleza Miami seguiremos dando guerra en la flota, y esperamos obtener un resultado mejor, si Eolo acompaña y la suerte no se muestra esquiva.
Os envío como adjunto una imagen de la llegada.</p>

However, the good news is that Abner and I are committed to the show and are well on our way to finding a new venue. We have excellent artists that are also committed to the show, including Komar and Melamid. We would still like the show to take place this spring/summer. However, the date is as yet uncertain and more likely to be moved farther into the future. As part of the move, we may expand the show into a much larger space, so please let me know the maximum dimensions of Communimage &#8211; I know you had a much bigger size in mind when we first made contact.
Best wishes, scott</p>


	<p>..no problem..thats how spaces go, time looks like..we’ll see if..and when..</p>

	<p>Renè Gabri writes..you remember? we met in Torino when he did a project with Erin and Heimo during <span class="caps">BIG</span>.. &gt; x-plo..the bus tour..René asks if c a l c wants to do something in the frame of <span class="caps">IUAV</span>..an university in venice..</p>


	<p>... The structure you would be invited by would be Intorno, a group that I have organized with the students, working with the model of 16beaver, and attempting to engage outside the school itself and engage/invite people they are interested in for discussions/events. ...</p>


	<p>..for april..hmm..no..big pitty, would have been great to see René again and being part of their discussions&#8230; but we’re boo©ed out..really can’t..</p>

	<p>i love the orange tree park!!! beautiful&#8230;love, h</p>


	<p>thank you!</p>


	<p>btw &gt;..omi and Nico are ping-ponging since weeks about the possibility that c a l c does a workshop in Belgium..or two workshops..one in the new studio-house he and Helena are renovating and enlarging in Antwerp ~ we’re co-imagining a project regarding g.a. and a kitchen which has to be installed there..a focusplace..wait..omi made an image when Nico showed some slides of the so-far-model&#8230;</p>

	<p>..and another workshop which Nico would like to organize for us..to work again with artstudents on an open g.a.question..and to find a partner who wants to help us economical realizing the prototype..we’ll see, we just sent all our new papers to Nico..</p>


	<p>and Nico sends an interview &gt; ”the uncensored version”.. Flash Art did an interview with him..or HU Obrist did.. anyway..the Flashpeople kicked parts out..but this is the original version!.. what else than arrogance can you expect from a mainstream- gazette which carries “the world’s leading art magazine” in its subtitle?</p>


	<p>..we’re visualizing all projects which fly around.. in order to decide if we want to partizipate this a-com-petition..&gt; el convento..the transformation from a monestry into a center for architecture.. we are very much interested! we will! deadline 7th of June! our second bigbaby! but first..&gt;</p>


	<p>working on the model of the model for Marseille..</p>


	<p>after turning the idea up and down..while siting around and playing with the model of the space.. we formulate everytime more the idea to work not with a “forest”, but with vertical layers of maps of reality..hanging from the ceiling..using the light- structure up there..</p>


	<p>..Juan mails an image of how he imagines to visualize cittadellartes network in this summers arte-al-centro- context..looks beautiful, but what has it to do with a network? nothing less symetric then that..and how we can read the “the hubs” in this kind of metaphor?</p>

	<p>..we are all shoked,
paralized..all activity gets transformed from one news-moment to the other and concentrated in front of the television in the bar around the corner..is it true? ..like this feelings from the 9/11 all over again.. we can’t concentrate anymore..what are we doing? for whom?..its like also our backgrounds and prospects exploded..and all presence lies in ruins..</p>


	<p>..it seems from the first moment that this was another cruelness directed by Al Qaeda..although the PP..the still governing party does its “best” to make us think something else..“ETA did it, <span class="caps">ETA</span> did it&#8230;” no doubts about ETAs bloody tradition..but you really think they would be so stupid to kill 192 people and leave 1000s in pain, dolor and trauma just some days before the elections? why? to make sure that those really good friends of Bush junior and his really good friends will win the elections?..something’s more implausible??..</p>


	<p>on the 12th we and around 700.000 more are demonstrating in the streets of Sevilla our total rejection for any act of terror, intolerance and fanatism! the Us-war in the iraq and the official actual Israelian “politcs” included!</p>


	<p>..even when proofs are getting obvious to the blind and deaf the PP’s are going on to invent their electiondevil! its making everything even more painfull..listen to only one little dialog..life..today..between the interior- minister Acebes and a journalist:</p>


	<p>Acebes:    <span class="caps">ETA</span> did it!
Press:       Do you have any proof?
Acebes:    No, but i have no doubts!</p>


	<p>this says all..and thanks to the whole universe the spanish are not as stupid as those people want them to be: on the 14th &#8211; election day &#8211; Mister Mustache and his loyal following may go a while to the second row..</p>

	<p>Querid@s amig@s
Finalizada la 6ª etapa de esta vuelta al mundo virtual (pero no por eso exenta de trabajo y esfuerzo) os envío como de costumbre una pequeña crónica de la misma.
La etapa comenzaba en Miami y el primer punto de paso obligado (Way point, &#8220;WP&#8221;, en el argot) estaba situado en la isla Bermuda, el cual había que dejar por babor, para a continuación franquear el 2º Way point en Nueva York esta vez dejándolo por estribor y de allí ir a meta situada en Halifax (Canadá). Nuestra actuación en esta etapa ha sido más bien discreta ( no sé si por influencia del &#8220;triangulo de las Bermudas&#8221;) pero el caso es que en el paso del primer WP quedamos cortos de barlovento y solo conseguimos remontarlo en la posición 40ª y ciertamente descolgados de la cabeza de la flota, a partir de ahí nada que objetar al resto de nuestra regata, al 2º WP llegamos alrededor de la posición 30ª y entramos en meta al fin en la posición 28ª. Resultado discreto pero que nos permite mantener la 1ª posición en la clasificación general a 10 puntos del 2º clasificado.
La siguiente etapa será entre Halifax y Oslo en fecha aún por determinar y procuraremos no acordarnos de Bermudas.
Como siempre os mando en un adjunto la “foto” finish de la regata.
Un abrazo Luis</p>

	<p>Querid@s amig@s,
llegados a Europa, en concreto a Oslo, después de cruzar el Atlántico norte desde Halifax ((Canada) impulsados por vientos fuertes y portantes a una velocidad media de 24,64 nudos, hemos conseguido un 6º puesto en esta 7ª etapa con nuestro barco VskTugas I, con lo cual aumentamos nuestra ventaja en la clasificación general hasta los 92 puntos con respecto al 2º clasificado.
La derrota nos llevó primero a costear Terranova adentrándonos en el Atlántico para dejar las Hebridas por estribor, pasar entre el norte de Escocia y las Orcadas y de ahí librando la punta sur de la península Escandinava ir a cruzar la meta enfrente de Oslo.</p>


	<p>La clasificación, en sus primeros puestos, queda como sigue:
1º VskTugas I&#8230;..............1.954 puntos
2º Akakino&#8230;.................1.862 &#8221; 
3º <span class="caps">VIRTUALROUTER</span> Team&#8230;......1.772 &#8221;

	<p>welcome</p>


	<p>Claudia and Gernot (planhaus) are launching parq..a “platform for personalised housing”..we were looking very much forward to see that..we were telling it already months ago to los p a n a d e r o s and were wondering how their first practicle step will look like..smell like..act like..</p>


	<p>we’re asking Gernot if he’d like to write something for the little book about geografia affettiva ..remember? the <span class="caps">BCD</span> invited us to do that book.. Gernot prefers to reflect on the working platform..not now in the still-conceptual phase..ok.. read you later then..</p>


	<p>..but Stefan Münker likes to! great..Stefan knows the project from the few little texts we wrote and from some telephone calls..more we don’t want to tell him or show him now.. when we all will go to L.A. in August we want to work on the layout..Stefan will be on holiday then..writing holidays.. holying writidays..</p>


	<p>Teresa still works on the c-dossier&#8230;therefore she needs a fresh overview of Casqueiro..writes to L°°ks..he does one, but as years went by there were not only houses growing &gt;</p>

	<p>until we’ll drive up to L.A. we want to have that dossier done, you know..do give it to people who might be interested to buy Casquiero..and to have a first small documentation of the re-construction..re-building..re-storing..re-birth of the mill&#8230;</p>


	<p>an e-mail from Gent arrives to omi &gt; through a contact Nico made.. gracias amigo! &gt;</p>


	<p>Dear Omi,</p>


	<p>We received the invitation to introduce the <span class="caps">CALC</span> project in Belgium and to organise a workshop in Belgium. As we told Nico, we&#8217;re interested to participate in this project because the project has a lot of overlapping areas with the On Line project. But we need more concrete information to decide and to organise the workshop. What is the concrete relation between the workshop and the finalisation of the project? What&#8217; s your timeframe, because for us it is possible to organise a workshop after october the 15th. For the organisation we want the collaboration of the <span class="caps">AIR</span> insititute in Antwerp (artists residencies), in fact they are willing to cooperate but we need more practical information, period, how many persons will come over, etc.</p>


	<p>Best regards,
Lieve Foncke</p>


	<p>Lieve is talking about geografia affettiva..with pleasure we would follow this invitation..we’re answering all her questions.. and wait..and wait..</p></div>

	<p>..we’re doing some little trips..Teresa and Topo left to the east..to Cabrales where this cheese comes from and to the beaches nearby..a week later Evita and omito are leaving for a weekend to the other direction..rias bajas.. to join the “festa do mar”..where they can see all this amazing old wooden boats..and hear by chance las celtas cortos ..they are still on tour! and although they sound like the radio ten years ago they are great..live..</p>


	<p>..Ruben and Märle and Curt stay in Casqueiro..Ruben is doing a lot of chocolate desserts..and omis parents are working a lot but tranquilo in the garden..</p>


	<p>the 6th village party in el parque del naranjo is getting closer!.. first we’ll have – as every year – the traditional soccergame between the married and the not..on sunday the 29th.. then as always la fiesta on the 2nd of September..Topo does the poster again..</p>

	<p>..guess Michelangelo likes it a lot and hope they’ll find ways to produce it!..imagine Alejandro comming back to Medellin with 2 meter long plates..</p>


	<p>there is so much to do here..almost everyday we work on another little renovation task..painting windows and doors again..repaint the northern outer wall of the mill house again..radical muckout in the studio..thanks to Curt we can do a lot more than we thought, but also a lot less on the other side..we still didn’t find a while to decidate on the book for the <span class="caps">BCD</span> about geografia affettiva&#8230;</p>


	<p>but the Casqueiro-dossier is ready! with this paper we want to find potential buyers..and then see what we can get and if it makes sense..Juice from LAstudio..our friend and neigbour and architect is almost ready with the official cost estimation..</p>


	<p>we’re not in hurry with that, but its getting everytime clearer that it would be the best..step forward..but as decided it is as open it is..all depends how the near future will feedback our proposals..and what surprises will arrive..</p>

	<p>Gallery Hämmerle sends this image above..a small version of this webscroll..from each partizipating group/person one image..we don’t understand why they didn’t use a real web- image but the one we sent before to give an idea about the space..will the gallery organize the “same” event in Los Angeles as they announced? will we partizipate again?</p>


	<p>Teresa and omi are doing a 2day beg-tour..from shop to shop..asking if they want to give something for financing the village party..people are every year more open and helpful..we get 800 €..and we’ll need that easily&#8230; Yheppa &gt; the puppet play we engaged for the children costs 600 already..</p>


	<p>..and another mail from Alejandro..from <span class="caps">UNIDEE</span>&#8230;he’ll propose united colors of illycups for this years cup- competition..</p>

	<p>summer is slow and nice and filled with wide open spaces and lights&#8230;but mainly we’re working.. the <span class="caps">NAVE</span> needs urgently some painting hands.. another 15 little holes opened up under the extremes of sun and cold and rain and what makes L.A. a stormy paradise..but we’re glad that this experiment (a housecovered only with linen) work for 5 years!</p>


	<p>then and when we hear/read from L°°ks..his totally absorbed by going from doctor to doctor.. making all kind of analyses to find out what really happens in his body..in his legs..there was even the suspicion for multiple sclerosis, but thanks God it isn’t..he just got the results from the neurologist!</p>


	<p>this might bring some big changes again..its quite sure that L°°ks will go for a while to Switzerland in order to do therapies he can’t do here at the edge of europe..</p>


	<p>..for sure we’ll go on together, but if he isn’t Casqueiros Scottie and caretaker anymore we face some new problems &gt; who’ll look after the dogs if nobodies here? and who’ll look after the huge garden..little jungle..? we need to take some desicions..</p>

	<p>..but it isn’t as bad as Christoph Draeger proposes in this mail which arrives today&#8230;what does he propose?</p>


	<p>Teresa is contacting some gardeners..people who could cultivate Casqueiro while nobody’s here..we can’t afford that but we have to..if we want to have the infrasculpture looking sexy when someones coming to check out if (s)he wants to buy..</p>


	<p>space is geting more and more open..although we know that big changes are ready to enter the existencial door we don’t know what all will come..and go..it depends so much on what these little butterflies do&#8230;and how open we are to perceive that..</p>


	<p>a mail from zai &gt; etoy..dear friend&#8230; ..
isn’t it interesting and strange how similar questions, plans and projects lead to completely different outputs..? boo©s? weblogs? somehow this orange suite-strategists are going the opposite way..lets see if our ways meet again after we orbited the world..moving in the predefined frame of an aesthetic and ethic system proposing redefinitions of what we call “values”..</p></div>

	<p>..this years fiesta was maybe the best one! yes, its stupid to compare parties, but this time we invited
a puppet play group for children ..YHEPPA from Oviedo..you remember? we made their logo some years ago..and started to do their website too..
a lot of children came! much more than we thought&#8230;and mothers and fathers..who tell us
that we should do that every year..we’ll try!</p>


	<p>David and Teresa are going from house to house asking people for the oldest photographies they got from La Fiesta de San Antolin..long before the little park was born..then they’re scanning all these images and project them during the night of the party.. people enjoy that simple game with time
and space a lot! some look like looking into a timemirror..</p>

he’ll stay and keep the mothership on course like always..but he’ll only be around ‘til november or so..and then probably go to basel for a while..maybe he even will stay for some years!
you know, L°°ks got this problems with his legs since he was a child..and doctors told him &#8211; after it got really worse the last months &#8211; that if he doesn’t start to work hard on some physiotherapies he’ll sit in a wheel- chair in 10 years! so thats why..</p>


	<p>this important l°°ks-step will influence and change
c a l c things a lot too.. together we start to find ideas and solutions for casqueiro..who lives here then? who looks after the dogs?</p>

	<p>&#8220;GUARANÁ <span class="caps">POWER</span> is an energy softdrink produced by a guaraná farmers cooperative from Maués in the Brazilian Amazon, in collaboration with Superflex. The farmers have organised themselves in response to the activities of the multinational corporations <span class="caps">XXXXX</span> and <span class="caps">XXXXXXX</span>, a cartel whose monopoly like position on the purchase of the raw material has driven the price of guaraná berries down 80%,
while the cost of their products to the consumer has risen.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">GUARAN</span>Á POWER employs global brands and their strategies as raw material for a counter-economic position while reclaiming the original use of the Maués guaraná plant as a powerful natural tonic, not just a symbol.</p>

see very soon that we could.. together..YES..lets do a workshop in Richard Foncke Gallery in 2005.. lets think about how we can link kunstonline and geografia affettiva (geanet) ..kunst-online wants to become more visual and structural on levelTwo, thats also why this could make an interesting mutual sense..</p>

	<p>we’re talking about the workshop and decide to focus on the notion of common memory..and on space &gt; how we can translate within a one week workshop questions of memory which reflect on geanet and kunstonline to the gallery space in Ghent? or should we look for another space, one which is less “arty” and maybe makes it easier for some people to enter..Lieve wants to invite architects..sociologists..she is mentioning Pascal Gielen&#8230;remember? he was the man who wrote the main text for the catalogue according the show we curated in <span class="caps">M HKA</span> last year..would be great if Pascal wants to partizipate!</p>

	<p>Hello,</p>


	<p>we, the curatorial team of the workshop “Methods – reseach projects on art society relations”, have now finished our selection process and are glad to be able to invite you as one of the participants of the workshop on October 2nd and 3rd at Cittadellarte – Fondazione Pistoletto, Italy.</p>


	<p>We chose six artists groups, working internationally on the question of creative processes within social contexts.</p>


	<p>The chosen groups are:
Bureau de Compétences et Désirs, France
c a l c, Spain
Katja Lindqvist, Sweden
<span class="caps">OUT</span>/Isola Dell&#8217;Arte, Italy
significans, Germany
Stalker, Italy</p>


	<p>As already mentioned in the announcement of the workshop, every participating group will also act as a counterpart for one presentation. Therefore we will send you until the 22nd of this month the text of another project, which we ask you to prepare for the discussion, thinking of possible questions and critical points.</p>


	<p>If you have any further questions, don&#8217;t hesitate to call us&#8230;Looking forward to having you all here,</p>


	<p>Juan E. Sandoval, Filippo Fabbrica,
Federica Cerutti, Julia Trolp</p>


	<p>..we’re looking forward to meet all these people..and to see how they’re doing..and what..and why..</p>

<span class="caps">BIG</span> and for the <span class="caps">M HKA</span> show..) knew them and made the contact – mille grazie Maria! ..as soon
as we have decided the exact form Topo will do
the autocad-plans..</p>


	<p>..in the meantime the women-house-for-Dajla-request is decided..they’ll do the project..and they start to negotiate..and search for some money..</p>


	<p>..aproposito solidaridad &gt; SI &gt; los postales..they only choose one..guess which one..right, the
less ambiguous..the most conventional..the sky..</p>


	<p>..good cargadero! nosotros nos ponemos de
nuevo cuando volveremos..y viva Dajla y Utrera..
let us know if we can tele-do something.. bye amores..we’ll be back in two long weeks..</p>

Enviado el: sábado, 25 de septiembre de 2004 7:46 Asunto: Romería en Tapana</p>


	<p>Crónica de una romería en Tapana, Vava´u,
Reino de Tonga.</p>


	<p>En el fondeo de Tapana, donde se encuentra el entrañable restaurante &#8220;La paella&#8221;, de unos españoles María y Eduardo, y cuyo menú es: gazpacho, tortilla de patatas, croquetas y paella, el 23 de septiembre de 2004 tuvo lugar una romería, la de la &#8220;virggen&#8221; de Tapana, con su manto rojo (un restillo de la tapicería) y sostenida por un báculo (bichero. Los romeros, vestidos a la usanza, y con la música de sus motores, se acercaban en los dingys y desembarcaron en la playa; allí una tríada de autoridades daba la bienvenida, portando luces (solares de jardín); a la derecha figuraba la primera dama romera con el traje de faralaes y su flor al pelo; en el centro, un personaje, ataviado con tricornio y capa de tuno, espíritu mixto de Franco y el Duque de Ahumada, lanzó un discurso y con una voz trémula y una mano tonta que subía y bajaba, decía: &#8220;Españoles, habéis recorrido muchos mares para participar en esta romería con la &#8220;virggen&#8221; de Tapana&#8230;....; pronto se yuxtapuso el espíritu de Ahumana, se fue calentando y empezó a querer atizar a los congregados. Después, los romeros, presididos por las autoridades, muy devotos todos, acompañaron a la &#8220;roja paloma&#8221; e hicieron el recorrido desde la playa, subiendo las escalerillas hasta el restaurante, con cánticos de sevillanas mal recordadas, algún &#8220;porón pon pero&#8221; y alternado con algún que otro bailecito aprendidos por algunas por la mañana ¡Viva la roja paloma! ¡Viva la virgen de Tapana!.</p>


	<p>Una vez arriba, entre el baile y el mal cante brindamos con el último &#8220;Beronia&#8221; navegado desde España y degustamos las ricas viandas preparadas por las tripulaciones de los cuatro barcos españoles (Calcetines, Cormorán, Aldo y Sur) y uno italiano (Maistracc). ¡Toda una fiesta en el Pacífico, a la usanza de la lejana tierra patria!</p>


	<p>Como veis, os tenemos en el corazón. Muchos besos,
Marisa y Lois.</p>


	<p>..shit..we forgot the digicam..aiii&#8230;we wanted to pass by Marseille to shoot the images Sylvie and Yanick couldn’t take..and take some measurements..aii..on our way back.. ..but no, before! ..they are also supposed to be part of the “methods-meeting”!.. remember? we’ll do an extension of their terrace their..project &gt; Cap Canaveral.. soon in this <span class="caps">BOOC</span>©..</p>

      <div class="body"><p>..Tal arrives today! welcome to citta’, how’sitgoin’? ..Tal came as a special guest for the the
“Methods-Meeting”.. he tells us that he wants to move to de Negef soon so he can work better with the beduins..he’s doing a project there which he calls “unrecognized villages”..there are some infos on his site about it..</p>


	<p>..the methods-weekend..hi everybody..except
Sylvie and Yannick from the Bureau des Competences et Desirs..they couldn’t come..too much on the fire.. so we’ll pass by Marseille on
our way back and see if we can take some images..and informations..</p>


	<p>..Bryan and Laura are here too! they were invited
as a kind of friendly disquieters from the audience side..rememeber them?..they were in <span class="caps">BIG</span>..and
run the <span class="caps">ARTISTHOUSE</span> in Leeds now..</p>


	<p>..these m-days are going quite well..are interesting, although we miss some kind of basic informations from some of the others.. if we talk about methods to realize projects we can’t leave out the method
of “finding” and “spending” money..often we find
that these kind of projects have a strange lack of reflecting on the financial side..that makes them contraversial..and boring on that side..</p>


	<p>soon they (cittas art office..) will have some papers ready ..about this weekend..we’ll add them next time probably.. the image below shows
Teresa and omi answering the questions from our “counterpart” the significans from Berlin..one of them asks if we not better would have realized an “internetcafé” instead of a park.. after telling them the NO-answer in 4 variations they keep on asking the same..Miss Pi is getting a bit angry..guess
L.A. and Berlin are just too far from each other..</p>

..affective turbulence!..</p>


	<p>Hi Omi – c a l c,</p>


	<p>Nat Muller was telling me that she met you in Italy,
and that perhaps youv may be interested in attending <span class="caps">DEAF</span>. We are quite interested in your work(affective geography in particular)and may be able to wiggle a short present- ation in &#8211; but we are beyond the bulk of scheduling. There is some fine tuning happening, and some cancellations so if you are interested send me a short bio, contact info, and a project synopsis and I&#8217;ll see what we can manage.</p>

	<p>El Sur llegó a las Islas Marquesas el pasado 9 de abril. Después de casi siete meses de vagabundeo náutico por los Mares del Sur y sus islas, se disponen a abandonar las latitudes tropicales para dirigirse a Nueva Zelanda, ya al sur del Trópico de Capricornio. Al parecer lo hacen en Vava&#8217;u, que en línea recta está a unas 2.200 millas de Las Marquesas, y a 1.150 de Auckland, al norte de Nueva Zelanda.
Adjunto mapita y, para más ilustración, unas notitas sobre Tonga: El Reino de Tonga, la última monarquía en Oceanía, es un pequeño país ubicado al este de Australia y al noreste de Nueva Zelanda, al sur del Océano Pacífico. El archipiélago decidió unificarse en una monarquía polinesia en 1845 y 55 años después se convirtió en un protectorado británico. En 1970 el reino obtuvo su independencia y desde entonces forman parte de la Mancomunidad Británica de Naciones, aunque a las Naciones Unidas no fue admitido sino hasta el año de 1999.Sus 169 islas (36 de ellas deshabitadas) suman 748 km² en los que viven unos 100.000 tonganos. La capital es Nuku&#8217;alofa, residencia habitual del rey Taufa&#8217;ahau Tupou IV. <span class="caps">EL PIB</span> per cápita se sitúa en $2.200 $ El rey elige a los jueces de la Suprema Corte, y no existen partidos políticos. De la infestación religiosa que sufren ya informa la crónica de los viajeros.</p>

Asunto: Por la mar océana
Desde Tonga a Minerva</p>


	<p>21º 45´S &#8211; 176º 26W / 16.11.04</p>


	<p>Ayer, 15 de noviembre, El Sur, de nuevo, se hizo a la mar océana; esta vez salió de Nuku´Alofa, la capital del Reino de Tonga, hacia un arrecife por allá perdido, de nombre Minerva, camino hacia Nueva Zelanda. Él iba con poco viento de aleta, contento y a unos cuatro nudillos, para recorrer, por una mar tranquila, doscientas cincuenta millas y poder llegar con luz de día al pequeño arrecife (merece la pena buscarla en una carta). Salió solito, porque a los dos barcos italianos aún les faltaba mucho para tener sus barcos a punto.
Desde hace varios días la vida a bordo gira alrededor de la recepción de información meteorológica; a tres horas distintas del día suena un inconfundible cric, cric, cric, de la entrada de los weather fax de &#8220;situación actual&#8221;, &#8220;a treinta horas&#8221; y &#8220;a cuarenta y ocho&#8221;; al atardecer nos enganchamos a la red, recibimos varias previsiones meteorológicas y además despierta expectación por si nos trae algunos correos personales, ¿para ti? ¿para mí?
Muchos besos,
El Sur</p>


	<p>..already some days after a <a href="https://old.calcaxy.com/calc/2004/CroniquillaMinerva%20Norte.doc">next report from Polynesia..from Minerva Norte</a> , its going towards New Zealand..will eVa and omi meet them in New Zealand end of winter..?</p>


	<p>eVa’s back from Cap Canaveral! ..she brought hundreds of images, measurements..drawings..
and a lot to tell from her talks with Slyvie and Yannick.. on the long run the terrace-project is
a whole-house- project&#8230;you’ll soonsee..we’ll present ideas and first plans end of feb.2005..</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>24th <span class="caps">OF NOV</span> &gt; surprise surprise! Ismael and Lourdes from Bilbao are comming to Sevilla! ..they want to see the <a href="https://www.fundacionbiacs.com/biacs3/">First International Biennial of Contemporary Art of Seville</a> ..and us&#8230;who couldn’t be farer from this Biennial&#8230;no, we don’t like it.. the whole show seems to ignore everything what is “contemporary” here..no links, no weaves, no dialog.. just names and arts.. like a peace nobody is going to..</p>
