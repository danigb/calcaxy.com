en carretera, camino de Peñiscola donde dormiremos esta noche, decidimos parar en Benidorm donde ni Teresa ni yo hemos estado nunca. paisaje increible, torres fantasma (estamos en invierno). más increible que la cantidad de edificios, la densidad y la altura es la cantidad de gruas&#8230; la cantidad de edificios que habrá. mezcla de atracción y repulsión. ahora entiendo porque <span class="caps">MRVDR</span> eligieron esta ciudad para su trabajo &#8220;Costa Ibérica&#8221;...en cualquier caso el libro me parece una porquería..</p>

	<p>tuesday &#8211; working on the CI for cittadellarte..since yesterday ..complete redesign..Miss Pi and omi are doing kind of a workshop with Armona and Marco from cittadellartes uffizi.. all week..we are looking for a dynamic logo which can change appearance without loosing recognition..on friday we present an organic bubble system to all people of all citta-uffizi..they like it..Marco will work now on all applications..depending on its reference the logo changes..such as cittadellarte as a whole entity the c-logo is dynamic/organic as well..it&#8217;s not a repeating signal like logos are normally, but a changing, growing and communicating code..:</p>

	<p>metaphorical the c-logo looks like a micro organism, a fractal structure, or the goundfloor of a cittadella..and these connotations aren&#8217;t disappointed by the sign &#8211; in fact it is all these things! a micro organism like cittadellarte is a growing,changing and exchanging organ in an international body named world, a fractal structure because each part (field) of citta&#8217; is related to all others and each contains the whole, a grounfloor of a cittadella because it&#8217;s the &#8220;groundfloor of content&#8221; of cittadellarte..</p>

Topolino and Teresa Miss Pi and Evita Gusanita and omito omeloni are leaving to Madrid..Sevilla..Miss Pi and Topi stay in M for a day or 2..Topi has a meeting with this engeneers firm for which he investigates theoretically on certain problems and projects..no vemo..cuidado..exito.. Sevilla..working on mamila
p°°l again..sending Liron a precise plan how the set up could work..still unsure if the city allows some hundreds of big balloon to hover around in mamila..and we start to doubt that the flying carpet is a good idea..maybe the single balloons should be independent? when Topo and Ms Pi arrive we decide to go to La Feria this afternoonight.. La Feria de Sevilla! caramba muchacho, if you didn&#8217;t see it if you didn&#8217;t dance it smell it hear it touch it taste it, you won&#8217;t believe it! almost all women are dressed like colves and men like elegant Zorros..</p>

	<p>que fiesta, tan cerrada como abierta, tan bonita como ugly..i mean why do they have to have these private bars everywhere? you need an invitation to get in..others, the bigbig ones with orchestra are &#8220;free&#8221;..&#8221;in Jerez its different..all bartents are public, people dance from bars to stripes&#8221;..lets go there next year..but before omi has to learn to dance sevillanas..the clovedance..</p>

	<p>cervesitas&#8230;Dani, the brother of Ruben comes too..Dani makes nice music and loves design! especially Stefan Sagmeister! he mentions Stefan as one the &#8220;best designers of the world&#8221;..omi and Teresa have to lough..not because they think it&#8217;s not true, but because the size of a small world..we tell Dani that we&#8217;re friends with Stefan..and that we maybe could invite him to do a workshop or something in Sevilla..Dani shines!</p>


	<p>on the 3rd of May we&#8217;re (Miss Pi, Topo and omi) back in Torino..ciao You..ciao springtime! 4th..its Miss Pi&#8217;s birthday! viva la presidenta! we give her a symbolic entrance to the flamenco biennial in Sevilla this september! since years MsPi is talking about going there..</p>


	<p>the next two days she and omi are in cittadellarte..doing together with Michelangelo, Cristiana and some people from the Uffizi the selection for <span class="caps">UNIDEE2003</span>&#8230;some very interesting applications reached us! we are looking so much forward to meet the a.i.r.!</p>


	<p>ciao Malex! 7th of May..until the 14th you&#8217;re the baby, we&#8217;re the ship;-)..we working hard and playfull on e.r.b.s.e..we realise that the first idea to build all up upon the searchterms isn&#8217;t realistic..first simulations You and Miss Pi are doing don&#8217;t show any surprising results..although we don&#8217;t like this kind of sportive art-events we are working with enthusiasm! and take now the index card of each book to visualise relations and proportions.. we have to send e.r.b.s.e on the 27th of May, lets do the finishing online..look ~ a websketch..:</p>

	<p>we decide to reduce the ball°°ns for mamila to ~500..each one with 100cm diameter and leaving 2 meters between the threads..to open the carpet to a forest, to make them more independent..not one crowded dance with the wind and the light/shadow, but fivehundred..this all came because the ~5000 ball°°ns of the same size are much to expensive to buy and to transport..to install..but in fact we think the idea got stronger by this compromise..the colour is still open..</p>

	<p>2nd hola Catherine, hola Michel! (two professors who together with Nico do a lets-open-the-questions-good job in the a-school&#8230;) hola estudiantes, somos Teresa and omi&#8230;we start with talking about c a l c, how it came, where we are and where we&#8217;d like to go to..</p>


	<p>in the evening we go for dinner with Nico, Catherine and Michel.. on the way to the restaurant a man lays in liters of blood, people all around..some are loughing, others can&#8217;t let their eyes from the blood..what happend here?..why is Perpignan so extremely violent? a lot of man wear knives..eyes in the street are hasty and nervous..</p>


	<p>we start..after we have shown some of our projects..with introducing geografia affettiva..but before we say anything we ask them all to write down a definition &gt; what does geografia affettiva mean to you?</p>

	<p>we had this idea already a while ago &gt; that we try to do more of these kind of workshops in which we&#8217;d like to bring the project further and offer in the same time to the institutions, organisations, etc. who invited us to become an active partner..which means that they get their own g.a. platform for their needs and contexts.. they can decide about the interface design..the criterion how to become a member, etc..so the partners would buy the package for little money, but because there are many it can be financed..</p>


	<p>Catherine, Michel and Nico like this idea..they will present the project (there will also be an exibition of all 8 workshops of this year soon..) to the responsables from the townhall and try to find the money there..</p>

	<p>more and more we think that also in Colombia in November g.a. should play an important role.. isn&#8217;t it a puente par excellence?!</p>


	<p>we do a paper on the 5th and last day..a big one..they can use this poster when they present all the workshops in some weeks: espace d&#8217;art contemporain la halle au poisson &#8230;.so this paper will serve to show the people what it is all about&#8230;we also will send all the digi-images we took..and the new paper we are going to write when we&#8217;ll be back in babyship..till the end it got clear that all the definitions they gave were right..all that can find place and expression in geografia affettiva..</p>

	<p>back in babyship..Miss Pi, You and omi are working on two things now: the big show in Antwerpen and geografia affettiva.. preparing the material for the workshop-show in Perpignan and the workshop in Jerusalem&#8230;</p>


	<p>in cittadellarte everything is going crazy right now..in few days the Venice biennial opens..Michelangelo Golden Lion will present in the utopian-pavillon from H.U.Obrist the love difference project&#8230; so imagine how our meeting with Michelangelo went? we had 5 minutes to talk about Antwerpen..then we went eating and talked about everything else&#8230;but its okay, there is big trust and there are good ideas&#8230;see you in some weeks..all the best for Venice!</p>

	<p>then we would like to talk to Alberto Ibero..a friend of Pedro and architect..the man who build the “Centro de Interpretacion de la Muralla Punica”..we liked it! we’re sure he can help us with this investigation on cartagenas bunkers..</p>


	<p>adios familia! thanks so much for everything, soon we’ll be back..and..Cartagena isn’t the ugly city everybody told omi.. it is if you look with a halfbrain-touristeye, but it isn’t if you get closer and in touch with people who decided to life (t)here! ciao belli!</p>


	<p>while Eva and omi talk about this possibility to investigate the military buildings in Cartagena, Miss Pi and Topo think about to do a project in “las 3000”..this quarter in Sevilla which they built to put los gitanos in “social appartments” ..which didn’t work of course..not the way the social planners wanted..we want to colaborate in both projects, the one way or the other..and of course things will be boo©ed..</p>

	<p>..and el puente..el puente joder! the theme of our workshop in Colombia..November, you remember? tranqui Juan, Cristina, omi, tranqui Evita, tutti calci y los niños en Medellin con Natalia..vamos hacer una buena cosa!</p>


	<p>when Eva meets omi and Juan in cittadellarte she proposes that each one comes with his own bridge-suitecase to Medellin.. full of working material..the problem is that we have one week after our arrival the opening..we like to understand this day as the day on which we bridge our projects to the public..and then go on the second workshop week with an open door..</p>


	<p>we see that we’ll have like 4 bridges which are all the “same” in the end, but which start from different shores: Eva and the physical bridge, the real bridge, architecture..she calls it the “extension of the banks” (-la extencion de las orillas), omi and the bridge of comunication &#8211; he wants to introduce geografia affettiva and invite to take some decisions together, Juan and Cristina and the bridge of daily social life &#8211; they want to bring the experience of a fiesta they organized in a neighbourhood in Biella to Medellin and see what this means in the colombian context..and Natalia and her students, which are bridging since months in Medellin already!</p>


	<p>we still don’t know if we should let everything open until we meet, just open our suitcases and share its contents and see around which aspect the theme mainly bridges, or if we should outline a clear programe for our two common weeks..we’ll see..you’ll see..</p>

5th villageparty of L.A.! Miss Pi and omi collected more money then ever..la fiesta is already known as something particular..compared to so many others on this coast the L.A.party is just more festive..off the big beaten commercial tracks (bigger, louder..) and back to the party roots (non profit, good-all-kind-of-music-for-all-kind- of-people, and all exept intolerance tolerated)..</p>


	<p>also Arno and Gabi had to leave today..they didn’t even pass by Casqueiro so busy was their sightseeing-agenda.. but amazing how sometimes things meet without causal connexion: Arno tells us that he worked intensively on the theme of the Bridge..in the context of the architecture forum.. he invited architects to investigate the “negative space” under a bridge (“the roofed space”..)..he tells us tons of interesting stories and finally we ask him if he wants to give us also a suitcase for Colombia..?..”maybe” he says..”maybe, i have to see if i find time to pack this bag..”</p>

	<p>Ana sent this bridge-image the other day..she’s back in Berlin.. studing construction engeneering now..she really does it!</p>


	<p>also him – Arno &#8211; had this kind off shock..but more than the “cultural palette” (“i want to go out of my house and find everything”) he missed this kind of “intelectual landscape” (“i need certain people to talk to”)...well..same as above..i mean.. how could you talk to them not knowing spanish? can you read eyes and gestures so well? do all “intelligent” people speak english? or german? or where is the center? Beuys knew what he did when he was “looking for the most stupid”..</p>


	<p>well anyway..anywhere..today the center is in L.A.!</p>

	<p>good that it was at least a payed contest..we’re all pretty broke..</p>


	<p>Oviedo..4th of September..hasta pronto amores..see you soon in Antwerp..when the big cittashow opens!</p>


	<p>this time Miss Pi and omi stop in Marseille to meet Sylvie, Yanick and the Bureau de Competences&#8230;hola amigos.. only some hours..but good ones! we let them know what geografia affetiva means and how we imagine to present the project in the Bureau..by a workshop..or two..maybe with students from the art- or/and the architecture faculty..that Eva had the idea to come with a 3D model of the interface..we leave them our g.a.papers and go before sundown.we’d like to make it to Torino before midnight..we’re looking forward to come back..</p>

	<p>one night in the babyshipbed and the 3 of us are back in Biella.. full programme..finishing the posters..doing the graphic..the 8 images and slogans we already chose with Michelangelo before August..4000 of those posters will be spread all over the city..inviting people to be curious..</p>

	<p>and of course the work with the residents..but again..little time to really follow and help them.. next year &#8211; if we’ll go on &#8211; we will definitely only do one project in the cittadellarte context either <span class="caps">UNIDEE</span> or..for example curating a show..</p>


	<p>one day after comming to Biella Nico Dockx and friends are arriving, a whole bus of them! they are on their way to Venice where they will do some performances in the Utopia Station..</p>


	<p>finally we can meet Louwrien Wijers..que bien..you know, the Women who invented and organized Arts meets Science and Spirituality in a changing Economy.. Nico told us a lot about her..unfortunately we’re too busy with <span class="caps">UNIDEE</span>-Antwerp to really take time for each other, but this first touch is much more than nothing! we will see us on the opening on the 4th of october in Antwerp..</p>


	<p>Peter the cook, the artist who works in the kitchen, is one in Nicos bus..they arrive just in the moment when there is no cook in citta..Maria and Salvatore also left and actually we wanted to go downtown to have some pizza..but then Peter discovers the deep freezers! madonna, we didn’t know what there was buried under ice! we have a great meal all together..</p>


	<p>Ni&#38;co are leaving, Catherine, Michel and some students from the art academy in Perpignan, where we did the first geografia affettiva workshop, are arriving..short visit, also on their way to Venice..they are invited by Nico..</p>

	<p>Tal is also here..you remember? Tal Adler..Itemz.org..he also will go to Venice, but he got invited by Filippo from the politic office of cittadellarte..Love difference..which is also present in this utopian pavillon..</p>


	<p>Tal tells us how we could propose geografia affettiva for the near east after it didn’t work out with the Musrara school..he tells us to get in contact with the people from the digital artlab in Tel Aviv.. thanks..we will..</p>


	<p>no news from Scott Snibbe and communimage in San Francisco.. maybe we should forget about? hey and did you read? Taschen made a big book about Muhammed Ali G.O.A.T..Greatest Of All Times..didn’t we always say in Goat we trust?..we have to lough about how funny synchronicity can be sometimes..</p>


	<p>its middle of September .. in <span class="caps">M HKA</span> the realisation of our plans start..the wire to Tom is excellent, we don’t doubt a second that this is the perfect partner..we only doubt that “perfect” means the same in Antwerp then here in cittadellarte..good that Miss Pi and You are already going up tomorrow..and will find out..omi will follow in about a week or so..only two weeks until the opening on the 4th of oct!</p>


	<p>we have this idea to do a poster for <span class="caps">UNIDEE 2004</span>..you know, there is this advertising pillar in the logospace which represents the education office..and it will be full of all posters which were made so far..it would be nice to also have the poster inviting for next years <span class="caps">UNIDEE</span>..we do a democratic design: each resident of 2004 (apart from Kai who still didn’t return from Tokio..) chooses one digit out of u n i d e e 2 0 0 4..from each one omi takes a photography of the left eye..the chosen digit desides which slice of the eye is part of the whole 11eyes-eye..what? this:</p>

	<p>Miss Pi and You almost didn’t arrive and send very good news already: Tom is as de Luxe as we thought! <span class="caps">AND</span>: they had an idea how to produce the Logo-Sofa in that very short time: <span class="caps">M HKA</span> will pay the production, after we’ll try to sell it and they get their expances back! now Tom de Luxe is trying to organize that..</p>


	<p>to come to the point: it worked!</p>

	<p>in the end he also invites Carlos (Evas brother) and his girlfriend Eli – okay, we are comming, but you are sure that there will be empty seats? “you can sit in the cockpit if not..” okay, we come! and we’ll meet Marisa and Lois to cross the canal of Panama &#8211; x-mas trip..is it true? did a real captain just invite us to fly with him to the Caribbean?</p>

	<p>good talk! Michelangelo also finds time, You is here too! and we are able to clear all the problems we had because of a lack of communication..from ours &#8211; c a l c’s &#8211; side we have to admit that we were overestimating our forces..we shouldn’t have done the curating of Antwerp and <span class="caps">UNIDEE</span>..this has actually nothing to do with this problem, but still: we would have been cooler if we wouldn’t have ha so much on ones hand..</p>


	<p>talking for almost two hours things get clearer between us.. there is no anger or misunderstanding left, right? Ryan is taping the talk..look, after some days he already sends us all an e-mail with the transscription. . .</p>


	<p>the presentation is getting closer, Colombia is getting closer, everything is getting closer <span class="caps">AND</span>: Teresa is back..since today! welcome Miss Pi, great that you made it some days before <span class="caps">UNIDEE2004</span> is finishing..</p>

	<p>Miss Pi and omi are doing a doblepage regarding the paradise..for this CH-magazine..the magazine for Captown..we decide to do something with two layers.. with an orange layer and with the plan of L.A. Miss Pi played before with the first portraits L°°ks did from the people of L.A&#8230;and with those images that we sent to the printer..but we want to keep it very simple..reflecting visual what happens in L.A&#8230;and to maybe work with this portraits in the Captownspace.. You proposed to let everybody in the village write about what for him/her means paradise..we don’t know..we just let it sleep in our common attention for some more weeks..</p>
