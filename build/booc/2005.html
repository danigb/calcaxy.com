Teresa and omi are happy to life and work in a larger group now.. with loves who are architects, with more minds to open..ideas..desicions.. what else art should be if not starting from the other?</p>

	<p>..sounds good.. ‘will be all done’, ‘of course’, ‘no problem’, ‘no te preocupes’..
..’nono, nada’ &#8211; Juice will follow the process ..if the mayors words become true they’ll start in spring to update L.A.! but mayers are normally too diplomatic to say anything, they just bubble into the potential of vote-air..so we’ll be very carefull..</p>

	<p>l°°ks’ living back home again, after so many years beeing <span class="caps">THE</span> casqueiro keeper and the you for everyone (even navias always-moody policeman asked omi the other day “donde esta el suizo?”) he had to leave us..and all.. to look after his problem with his knees, his body.. soon intensive physio-therapies in Basel will start and its totally open how everything will go.. how much energy this will del°°ksuate.. if we stay a team ~ try to give frames and features, and form a teleteam or if we have an art-break.. but never a heart break_art..= friendship.</p>


	<p>..the dogs?! Alfonso our nearest neighbour, the orthodox anarchist, says ‘i’ll take care of them!, you don’t worry, i take care, you know i like your dogs’ ‘and the dogs like you Alfonso!’..omi says..and has to leave in few days..</p>


	<p>Casqueiro will be alone for the first time then.. millhouses don’t like to be alone..they are built for working, for turning around a task.. and when you stop the wheel they become bitter..decide to be flora, play roots and suck water even from the dust..and start to stink..and to invite every weird insect-beeing you can imagine!.. but Alfonso who’ll come everyday..great, gracias amigón! ..and Juice and Alvaro and Amador got keys too and wheel up from time to time..</p>

	<p>before omi goes he’s working on a buisness card.. for our other neighbourfriend ‘Potcholo’ Sergio, the carpenter who made all the furniture in the <span class="caps">NAVE</span>.. this card is a gift for him.. together with Juice from LAstudios and some other friends from the village we’ll print and pay it.. Potcholo likes this one the most.. “el carpintero imposible”..&gt;</p>


	<p><img src="/files/xymedia/0000/1159/sergiosuarezperez.png" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Potcholo is living with a very serious health problem, you know&#8230; he has to let carpeting for some months..or even years.. so this card is supposed to be a kind of medicine from his closest neighbours..</p></div>

	<p>Hi,  The magazine is a-n magazine &#8211; a leading magazine in the UK for professional visual artists. The web link is <a href="https://www.a-n.co.uk/">www.a-n.co.uk</a> . I am developing some material for a-n on &#8216;Future Space&#8217; &#8211; what kind of conditions will artists need to work in and to present work in in the future? My first task is to compile short profiles of forward thinking international organisations which are artist led, or support artists &#8211; these profiles c a l c has been mentioned as a potential model project, so this is an initial request to find out a bit more about you. If you have material which describes, in brief, the history of c a l c, its mission, philosophy and activities that would be great.
Many thanks

	<p>and.. scott snibes again! cui in San Francisco? :</p>


	<p>Dear c a l cies &#38; Johannes Gees,
  I know it has been some time since we last corresponded. As I mentioned, the gallery we were going to exhibit &#8220;Social Construction&#8221; in closed. However, my co-curator, Abner Nolan, found a new venue which is much larger and better. The institution is called &#8220;Southern Exposure&#8221; and is one of the best respected and well-attended art institutions in the city. We have confirmed our show which will open on May 13, 2005 and close June 18. I would like to ask if you would still be willing to show your work? We have a slightly better budget, so we can offer a US$200 honorarium for your team. We should also be able to cover the printing costs. Finally, since the space is so large, I think we will be able to exhibit the work at the original size you specified &#8211; approximately 10m x 10m. Can you also send me a brief, one paragraph description of the work, and how you would like the work attributed &#8211; the precise language describing the creators of the work. After you agree, I will pass you off to the Gallery Manager, Kristen Evangelista, who will serve as your main contact. She&#8217;ll send you an official invitation letter and more details about the show.
I&#8217;ve attached an image of the gallery and gallery plan. The wall we think is best is the 33&#8217;2&#8221; wall that is a vertical wall in the center of the plan. In the photograph, it&#8217;s the wall to the left, which is a bit obscured in the photo. With my best wishes,

	<p>scot asks for a text for communimage in san francisco.. omi writes a kind of hippiecard.. ironical ballkicking arnoldism &gt; mr. govonor!.. goes like that:</p>


	<p>if you’re going to San Francisco..communimage in Arnolds County!</p>


	<p><a href="https://www.communimage.net">www.communimage.net</a> is a collaborative art project since 1999 and was developed and pre-presented in the context of the Swiss expo2002. Since then the project attempts to entertain a visual global “polylogue” and grows without any censorship or hierarchic control.</p>


	<p>The inputs from about two thousend people from all around made that it can be seen and played today as a “city of image”. c-imagecity manifests itself as the free sparkling source code of a free-minded-love-choise-speach-information-society. Welcome to California, the cradle of this Dream!</p>


	<p>Is it a coincidence that the proportianal relations between ‘neighbourhood-productions’ and ‘pornographic-productions’ are about the same in California and in communimage (~97:03) ? communimage is californian!</p>


	<p>These rights couldn’t be expressed and this dream couldn’t be exposed in some countries on this globe. To be guest in realspace California with communimage means a special spatial honour to its six starting architects. We want to use this opportunity to send greetings to the Governor of the State of California Mr. Anrnold Schwarzenegger, express our respect and share with him the knowledge and the identity of a history which became comon by defending these rights.</p>


	<p>Grüssgott Terminator! From shady Europe to sunny California, and our most honest wishes for the ray of light which lets you also see that these rights don’t end where death rows and software copyrights start, but in the free world with the violation of them with the Trailer of a Thriller.</p>


	<p>Mr. Governor, be a real heroe again, remember your roots and do a revolution! First in yourself, then within your state and then in the whole Republican Party of the United States of America! communimage!</p>


	<p>We don’t know if we’re also speaking in the name of the two thousend continuing architects, we hope, but actually don’t care.. communimage either, and shows that.</p>


	<p>Thanx to all c-citizens of California and of communimage for initiating and helping us bringing this piece over, viva la communimagination! may it bring peace to the world!</p>

	<pre><code>c a l c c 02_2005</code></pre>


	<p>how can we remember something if this something is absent?
the answer Sokrates gave in a platonic dialog is maybe a
cultural sourcecode of what we know about memory &gt; (wo)man,
so Sokrates, owns as a gift from Mnemosyne, the mother of all
muses, a board of wax, in which memories can imprint themselves
like from a signet ring. whatever leaves an impression can be
remembered until this impression is fading and oblivion initiates.</p>


	<p>looking at geografia affettiva with this platonic spatial view and playing
conceptual with its telematic feasibilities provokes some interesting
questions and possibilities &gt; do we have &#8211; finally &#8211; collective wax
boards? &gt; is our memory getting “better” because we can outsource
it into an artificial kind of screen-brain which doesn’t fade out? or
should on the contrary a system like that also have a facility to
forget? and first of all &gt; what shall that be: a collective memory?</p>


	<p>if memory (Mnemosyne) is the mother of all muses and an individual
memory only can be formed via social interaction what happens if
this interaction can be mapped and contexts be seen as &gt; a net
cartography of these interactions? do our relations change and
does our identity? what happens to what we call past and presence?
and does the system help to project the future?</p>


	<p>during our workshop-week in the <span class="caps">RFG</span> we’d like to share these
questions with you and leave the result as a kind of spatial memory
for the public.</p>


	<p>since geografiaffettiva.net was developed in all its questions by
bringing them on public tables also our <span class="caps">GRF</span> experience will &gt; be
translated onto its blog-like website and soon, when we’ll be able+
to play with the prototype, in-formed better. we hope until we meet!</p>

	<p>..we decided within ca_pa (c a l c and lapanadaria) to see and to inform the whole <a href="https://www.lightmachine.info/"><span class="caps">GRF</span>-space</a> as a huge white black-board.. everyday our circle of chairs move..from one clue to the other..and with chalks, post its and everything people like to add we in_form and deepen what the clue touches, provoces and generates through our plays and talks..</p>


	<p>..meanwhile in Sevilla it rains surprises &gt; the <a href="https://www.casamasomenos.net/">casa + o – project</a> goes even better than we were hoping&#8230; they already sold 4 or 5 flats&#8230;the project provoces what we intended: a discussion about the misery of actual ‘social’ housing.. of course this is just a start and so many details can be improved, but it is a serious proposal to get prices and wishes more adapted to people and their needs.. the biggest problem of doing realy big steps towards a change are the realty prices.. and the sharks in the sweetwater.</p>

	<p>Malex arrives from Zürich on day/clue 4 &gt;</p>


	<p><span class="caps">CLUE 4</span> &#8211; thursday &gt; <span class="caps">THIS IS A COLLECTIVE MEMORY</span></p>


	<p>definitions collective:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>a term without any mean in computer science
	done by or characteristic of individuals acting    together; &#8220;a joint identity&#8221;; &#8220;the collective mind&#8221;;    &#8220;the corporate good&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>




	<p>definitions memory:
&gt; an electronic memory device; &#8220;a memory and the    <span class="caps">CPU</span> form the central part of a computer to which    peripherals are attached&#8221; 
&gt; the power of retaining and recalling past    experience; &#8220;he had a good memory when he was    younger&#8221;</p>


	<p>how is geanet, seen as a tool for generating a visual collective memory, defined as such, if its structure is a hybrid memory between the electronic and the human memory?</p>


	<p>reflections:</p>


	<p>in a conceptual (philosophical) way:
1 about what is &#8220;collective&#8221; nowadays (reflecting    also on the <span class="caps">GRF</span>-space itself as an art-space (...)    touching the problems of responsability, control,    authorship, copyleft.
2 from the individual to condividual (attitude and    backgrounds)
3 the concept of “multitud” (crowd, mass)
4 history and collective memory, differences and    similarities</p>


	<p>relations beetwen these concepts and geanet
1 community &#8211; a base concept in geanet
2 how is a community in geanet defined?
3 how can you visualize the others information and    therefor generate your &#8220;personal collective    memory&#8221;?
4 data bank and &#8220;probability bank&#8221; &#8211; how can    geanet work as a &#8220;generator of contacts, ideas    and exchanges? how can it increase the    probabilty that we find each other over our    problems, questions, ideas? (reflecting at this    point also on our previous days regarding archive    and memory &#8211; semantic and associative memory)</p>


	<p>technical issues:
1 about the open source &#8220;philosophy&#8221; and its    relation with geanet (basic distinctions in working    effects between final determined closed ond basic    predetermined open codes)
2 an &#8220;open software&#8221; for geanet as a principle for    common memory
3 communimage &#8211; reflecting on an example of    collective memory on-line (how &#8220;now-collective&#8221;    created a visual collective by the programm    background)
4 how to store data in geanet (touching the basic    question of the week and the theme of <span class="caps">CLUE 5</span>:    how can a data-bank forget without loosing    information for its activity?).</p>

	<p>..en fin – we brought back home what we were hoping to bring: an answer how to deal with geanets memory..there will be a kind of oblivion..data will fade out, but not completly fade away.. and can be re_membered if certain interests touch them again.. soon (..) u’ll understand by playing with this domain..</p>

	<p>thanks..Jan and Lieve.. Tom from Brussels, Maria..Nico, Peter..all of u..who came and helped us to undestand better.. and to Simon Morris..who did a kind of contra_dictionary speach_performance the last clue-day.. showing us a project he did..re-writing Freud..</p>

	<p>Omi, Topo and Malex having a last belgian beerevening with their hosts Lincy and Franky from the bed and breakfast place their were living these days.. they are profesors&#8230;Franky for history, Lincy for Latin..Latin? wow, we might would have learned something if we would have had such an atractive teacher..’yes!’ says Franky ‘among aaaall latin teachers in Belgium Lincy is a sex bomb!’</p>


	<p>see u in Sevilla amig@s..bye.. first leaves Malex.. back to Zurich..bye Mali, lets do things like that more often! when will you stop working for this software company there and live with us? then Topo..back to Mama Pi and the LOLAbelly.. omi continues his trip &gt; to Antwerp and Middelburg.. checking out this invition to curate..the people/spaces..</p>


	<p>..while Topo and omi are waiting for the trains they see this gothic mix.. a media skyline.. last memory before their ways are ramifying.. ‘adios babba top! ‘ciao uncle funkle’ ta’ pronto en el horno andaluz’..</p>


	<p><a href="/files/xymedia/0000/0845/gothicghent.jpg"><img src="/files/xymedia/0000/0843/gothicghent_th.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>


	<p>..and while trains roll in three directions the phone rings in sevilla.. la <a href="https://centro.us.es/arquitectura/">Escuela tecnica superior de arquitectura de Sevilla</a> calls&#8230; they have seen what we did for casa + o -.. the website .. and they liked it so much that they want us to do the redesign of theirs.. bravo, guay..venga, nos vemos pronto pa’ hablar del tema..</p>


	<p>...omi and Bart meet in the <a href="https://www.muhka.be/">MuHKA</a>.. talking about what and how they imagined to have c a l c active&#8230;okay, first omi will meet Mister Rutger and his Vleeshal, then he’ll be back to see the collection..the things from which c a l c is invited to choose..and to present..</p>


	<p>..<a href="https://www.acsn.nl/activities/buildingliberty/information.html">Middelburg</a> ..&gt;Zeeland..Holland.. a city like a kind of dutch Mandala.. but it wasn’t the core which gave this form, it was war.. ‘hola Rutger, thanks for picking me up’ seeing the Vleeshal for the first time &gt; a gothic butcher-market which then became the townhall..was destroyed and renovated by the fashists and became then later the center for contemporary art &gt;</p>


	<p><a href="/files/xymedia/0000/0849/vleeshal.jpg"><img src="/files/xymedia/0000/0847/vleeshal_th.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>


	<p>(..the image above was done later..on the 23rd of June when omi came back.and the setting up started already..)</p>


	<p>having lunch with Rutger (director), Angela (curator) and Kees (chief technician) in Restaurant Vriendshap.. now its clear: the piece which will fill the Vleeshal is supposed to be Uffizi Porte, which was bought by the MuHKA and which we developed with Michelangelo about 2,5 years ago.. and “around” we shall select works from MuHKAs collection.. we still cant imagine how this ‘self celebration’ could work if we’ll be the curators, but lets have first an overview on MuHKAs collection.. collect as much as possible information and discuss this problem then back in sevilla..</p>


	<p>..omi meets Peter Verwimp in Antwerp&#8230;remember Peter? he was the cooking DJ in <a href="https://unidee.cittadellarte.it/unidee2004/residents/peter.htm"><span class="caps">UNIDEE 2004</span></a> ..</p>


	<p>..Peter’s busy.. painting a flat of a friend..Charlottes flat.. omi wants to be co_busy.. different kind of busy..so they paint together.. two nights, while miss Charlotte is somewhere in the states.. they do a good job and have fun wasting energy.. everthing’s white now.. exept one little corner on the ceiling which they leave unpainted.. like a memory_cube, a flip_space as a present for Charlotte..and the first tiny ‘common project’ Peter and omi did..good start!</p>


	<p><a href="/files/xymedia/0000/0853/charlottescube.jpg"><img src="/files/xymedia/0000/0851/charlottescube_th.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>


<blockquote>
	<p>2nd <span class="caps">OF MAY</span> going through the material of MuHKAs collection with Angela.. all they can see they see, all they can read they read.. but they can’t touch anything, they can’t see the real things, just weak virtual shadows which are definitely <span class="caps">NOT</span> a base for deciding.. we got a problem!</p>

</blockquote>




	<p>the only way to deal with that..the only one we can imagine now..is to make this problem a project.. to somehow work on this ‘archive’ which isn’t an archive as it should be..could be.. lets see it closer back in Sevilla..all together..</p>


	<p>Peter and omi meet again.. byebye_night.. when they walk through Antwerps dark night streets they all of the sudden find themselfs in a stange surreal situation.. actually nortereal..anyway, there is this young and rich man sitting in his fat luxury car..talking to an old man who got an old rusty bike with him.. when P and o walk by, the old man, who looks like a Karl Moses Marx, asks them: ‘whats the most important thing in life’ ‘hmmm, <span class="caps">LOVE</span> they say almost simultaneous..’and whats that?’ says the old man..’thats the energy which makes things become alive..’ that was the keyword for the old man.. he starts and doesn’t end until P and o leave to give a speach about his universal view.. which is quite drunk..quite weird.. but also quite beautiful at this spot, at this late hour.. the young man in the car looks like his pupil.. ..good night folks.. yes, the only revolution which is left is the loveolutiuon..’bye Peter..see u soon..when i’ll be back in Antwerp and Middelburg round the 20st of June&#8230;’</p>


<blockquote>
	<p><span class="caps">END OF APRIL</span> ..while in the streets of Antwerp these three strange man say goodbyes, mothership Sevilla got a paper ready..ca_pa proposes geografia affettiva again &gt; Manresa.. a respond to the invitation which reached us some months ago..</p>

	<p>..but..of course omi won’t leave ant_werp be4 he didn’t meet Tom de Luxe.. remember? he was the comic_angel who helped/solved us so much when we were fighting with all these problems while setting up the MuHKA_ cittadellartearte_ show.. Tom le Grande.. ‘maybe we can colaborate again Tom?’ .. ‘would be great, let me know what i can do..’ ..’skype ya soon brotha comix!’</p>


	<p>on his flight back omi stops in Madrid for some hours and meets ~ finally ~ Maria Sande, the communication boss of <a href="https://www.solidaridad.org/">solidaridad internacional..</a> they became online_friends while making these <a href="https://www.solidaridad.org/71revist.html">maga_si_nes</a> together..and just had to have an offlinexperience.. are they offlinefriends too? coño pues si joder :-) !..</p>

	<p>..the rest of ca_pa’s working on the archi_uni web now&#8230; space-net.. spatial webbing.. arch_i_texture..we talk/play a lot about how to translate the building itself into a web..a visual information in more senses than icon_kitsch.. a navegation metaphor abstracted and pointing back to the real thing about and in which all contents are turning.. &gt; very first sketch we did.. the groundfloors and associated fields of content ~ we’re just analyzing this whole chaos the got now..and playing on first layers..&gt;</p>

	<p>..for Middelburg we propose a game which intents to generate a ludic archive &gt;</p>


	<p>kind of “be a curator for a day play” ..</p>


	<p>we imagine how this game can output some serious results on which the development of their archive will be easier..because the access gets streched.. in order to play the game we first of all have to develop a system..a grid in which each work has its data-bed.. do we have time to do that? only if the MuHKA and the Vleeshal agree 100% on co_risking.. first proposal we sent was <a href="https://old.calcaxy.com/calc/2005/calc_input_01.doc">that one..</a>&#8220;</p></div>

	<p>..at night &gt; Santi and omi working on the fat chicken again &gt; el gran pollo de la alameda.. its growing crowing, egg by egg, ping by pong..1000s of images need to be seen and selected..most texts still are between ink and send.. just a basic structure done..in which they slowly let decided contents drop in.. all people..people who got their pages in that document..who come to see what they are doing feel inspired to finally finish and bring their material.. texts which are missing.. footnotes, a-pollo seems to really blast of now.. they are confident&#8230; k i k e r i k i !</p>

	<p>..restructuring <span class="caps">UFFIZI PORTE</span> for Middelburg..it doesn’t fit the way we proportioned it for Antwerp.. but thats fine.. easy, its an elastic stucture, its meaning doesn’t lay in a final constructed drawing (‘sculpture’), but in a contexted thought which proposes to start from naked (‘framework’).. Tom helps us again..and sends after some chats this drawing.. bien, we’ll do it like that &gt;</p>

	<p>..+ we are looking so much forward to see these two structures together..constructing something else than the sum of its parts.. the rising gothic and the on_growing cristal..but now time is running.. we still don’t have a standing concept ready.. second proposal is this one..</p>


	<p><a href="https://www.casamasomenos.net">www.casamasmenos.net</a> works so well! and as better the news become (los panaderos venden pan caliente) as more critical we see this project.. how can we improve the basic idea of the relation between the right to live under a roof, the flexibility of space and price and &#8211; on the long run &#8211; to imagine architecture as an open_source_field of shared structures.. which can respond to this right and this wish? ..anyway..there are people in the line and we face the basic problem..which shows apparently everything senseless &gt; the speculation/value of realties. where..how can we interfere on that level?</p>


	<p>..while we wait for Rutgers and his teams feedback we compile a CD for Themes and Hudson again&#8230; miss Maria Fusco made a contact a while ago..saying that ‘they’ are working on a book about artistic_public_..well, she asked for material about the park for L.A. ..a fat orange CD leaves to London today..with nearly all images and text we got..so Maria can choose and compose her own little bookpark..the villagepeople will be happy seeing this book announced in the vitrine near the park..</p>


	<p>..Vleeshal.. we are almost happy that Rutger can’t risk to collaborate on input_02..and understand..share his doubts ..NOW that we only miss a little month until the opening.. okay, treasure-drawer, swallow that, we have to work on input_03..which is a simple and straight proposal to show <span class="caps">UFFIZI PORTE</span> in the big gothic hall.. and let someone else select works for their other spaces..</p>


	<p>..right after another immediate call from Rutger ~ we’ll work on input_03 ~ we make the invitation card &gt;</p>

	<p>..and there was a mysterious auto-delete-happening which made the booc-folder disappear..and with it all our notes, mails, …so, whenever you are reading &gt; (inboxbooc) know that the linked text or image is gone into the blind black of the hardisknirvana.</p>


	<p>so how to go on with the booc, now that everything feels new and c a l c looks more like a bunch of babies than an old experienced whale? we decided to write this fattest and fullest of all chapter-times in a kind of telegram-way.. to not forget our own art history and to bring an idea to an end, or a new start.</p>


	<p>we’ll take spime (space and time as one liquid..) and we’ll see what presence, the crossing of moments and qualities will suggest.. and will let u know.. until then we just will go on to update c a l c a x y with new little icons and links towards the new projects we are doing bringing on their way..</p>


	<p>okay..lets rewind until where we stoped the flow and tell you six telegramonth for now:</p>

	<p>when omi gets to the hotel late at night after working on the setting up of the structure he finds 6 salesmen in the lobby watching a hardcore pornmovie on the big LCDscreen..like they were watching the new years concert.. ”ooo young man, come one join us and see these lovely film with us!..” ..”no thanks, I have to sleep now”..</p>


	<p>up in his room he switches on the TV and watches a documentary about an indian taxi driver who decided to cross all India from south to north driving only backwards.. the man explains that this way he can drive all through the past and become clear about all his memory.. switching the channel afterwards he watches another documentary about people who call themselves asexuals.. after listening for 15 minutes he believes that there are really people who never think and never enjoy sex.. are they driving backwards to?</p>

	<p>omi has to select images for the back-projection..its already 3 in the morning and he would prefer to go to sleep, but..he opens the folder from all images he and others took in the last cittadellarte-years..and types <span class="caps">ENTER</span> to make the program show all images random wise..lets have a first look..</p>


	<p>the first image which opens changes his life! &gt;
<span class="caps">PAM POPS UP</span>! PAM<img src="?" alt="" />?!? where are you, what are you doing, when do we meet?’ he thinks..and can’t go on working.. so much he feels touched by the memory and curiosity this image provokes! ‘PAM..PAM..how could I not have felt this whish to see you again before?’.. before implodes in a huge now.
..
aiaiaiai..
..
remember? (clickback to 2003 and see the massive attack concert entry..) they met about 2 years ago in cittadellarte.. there were lightsparkles jumping between them whenever their ways crossed.. <span class="caps">PAM</span> was working in the economic office then.. but actually she was the most interesting artist this year &gt; the one with the fewest fears to come out..</p>


	<p>omi can’t stop looking at the pop-up-pam-image
‘what an amount and clear colours.. this memory..’ the same late night he can chat with Juan, his friend who works in cittadellarte..and who’s right now in Venice setting up the same structure in the biennial context…and asks him for PAMs number..he got it, he got, he got it!</p>


	<p>Juan will arrive in Middelburg in some days..for the talk &gt;</p>


	<p>omi writes to <span class="caps">PAM</span>.
..can’t remember that an intuition ever has been so strong..or is it just a wishwave? he’s sure that they have to meet..‘to get married’ he thinks.. and loughs and falls asleep like the happy idiot who’s dream started with open eyes.</p>
