	<p>what did we do last weeks?
before we (T&#8217;n o) were leaving to Turin right after our fast-period (smelling like babies again!) we sent www.novaron.ch online &#8211; the site should be as clear, easy and discret as their architecture is. we had the idea to instal also the firstBOX in a black&#8217;n white version, but now we call it the square. with the square we did all novaron icons…</p>


	<p>2002! happy new yeah &#8211; feliz si nuevo &#8211; gutes neues ja to all of you, salemaleikum and shalom!</p>


	<p>the €uro is here. it just happens. no bang, no big articles, no riots, no spectacular robberies, just a huge logistic swash. it looks like fake money, past time money, not a glimm of &#8220;art&#8221; like the swiss money or of &#8220;mystic&#8221; like the US money. just money. for weeks people talk about it, like they talked before about the weather. the markets are the sky, this money are the new clouds and we all wonder will it bring rain or sun. and for whom? we remember that omi once partizipated Chris Byrnes project &gt; the strange case of the euro some years before. or just months?</p>


	<p>did we already tell that Karin Frei called us? she&#8217;s a curator and asks for the orange-prints we did concerning the park for L.A.. she asks if we still have some…&#8221;ooo yes, there are still around 10 of the small ones and 4 of the big ones&#8221;…she tells us that she&#8217;s building up a collection for an insurance company in Frankfurt; they want to collect &#8220;project like calc does&#8221; …Karins call comes in a good moment: we don&#8217;t have any money to bring the park- project further, but ideas. it sounds like she wants to buy them all! great! its good to be insured.</p>


	<p>before we&#8217;ll leave on the 13th to Turin Sandra and Jose visit us. Jose Rapper, our friend from Navia since our very first days here. he&#8217;s studies bellas artes now in Bilbao and Sandra studies the same, but in Salamanca. how it comes that art became an attractive job? they show us there ideas for a &#8220;showmonth&#8221; next summer in Navia and ask for our colaboration. sure, we&#8217;ll be part, but we won&#8217;t be able to do organization or money-searching stuff… they want to do several meetings and panel discussions, parties and exhibitions. for Navia this will be documenta I ! what space we can use? the so called casa de cultura in Navia is an antispace. hmm, maybe we can rent a big top? Sandra talks about having a band playing circus music.</p>


	<p>13th &#8211; Teresa and omi are leaving &#8211; just for two weeks &#8211; l°°ks, who writes his name with two degree-marks now, stays. as always. but this time Märle and Curt are here too, so timeless time won&#8217;t be too timeless this time.</p>


	<p>first night in a hotel near Carcasonne. we meet family Gaddis from southengland. they &gt; Mama, Papa have enough from the english way and weather, they move to the mediterranean spain. their two girls have to have enough too. Agatha Christie would have liked this place. we have dinner with family geddis, Mama, Papa and the children and the owners &gt; Mama, Papa and the mother of the Mama. Papa was captain of a Boeing for Air France, Mama a stewardess, and Grandmother had the house. the evening is nice. miss Mama tells us that since they have a website they have 40% more guests! and we all get angry later, sad, worried when talking about the 11th.</p>


	<p>we drive to Menton the next day while L°°ks starts to work on some dhtml-scripts for our new websight &#8211; calcaxy 3.0. its planed since a year you know, but… long ride, few words, many stops, little music, glad to be in a family. we stay 2 days again in sunny retiree paradise Menton. the chinese restaurant is so good! nothing. sleeping. reading the menu, watching TV and preparing ourselves for 10 crazy days in Turin…walking at the coast.</p></div>

	<p>we arrive in cittadellarte. back home in the mirror. we have to consider this sistership as a co-mothership, ciao tutti, come va? annette schindler from plug_in -basel writes, they&#8217;d like to show communimage during the &#8220;museums night&#8221;…a certain night they invented there in order to provoce a social batparty, we don&#8217;t know, but we agree. they gonna project the growing image into the the space, as well as they gonna project the plug_in space into communimage. nice surprise. first of all because its spinning back threads of time. we come from there&#8230; ciao Lina, hola Hänsel!</p>


	<p>two weeks in italy, regarding <span class="caps">BIG</span> and cittadellarte: twanging twists &#8211; feeling so welcomed by the warm hello of the whole cittacrew. Juan, muchacho! a mail arrived from Juan Alberto from Medellin, asking if Juan and calc would like to do a project in &#8220;his&#8221; centro hispano americano in Medellin. yes, we&#8217;d like to! southamerica! maybe 2003, or 4?</p>


	<p>Dagmar, Pierre and Paula are coming to Biella. the people who invited us to Berlin. business and art, artness and biz…. Pierre invites us to Kopenhagen in Mai. he&#8217;s organizing a huge meeting with managers and artists in the university where he&#8217;s teaching. Michelangelo will go, calc can&#8217;t &#8211; we&#8217;ll be working than in <span class="caps">BIG</span> Cavallerizza …</p>

	<p>big meetings, the whole artistic committee and company. the big social game doesn&#8217;t play too good within this meetings. too many mobile phones tweeting, opinions clashing, time running. artventure…but maybe that&#8217;s also why it plays well. this is reality, big social game. ciao Nico Dockx! (the artist who will do the Big-catalogue in colaboration with <span class="caps">BELLISSIMO</span>. hola Jennifer Tee! (the artist who came to see what she can do..) hola Miklos Erhardt! (the artist who is working with Dominic Hislop as bigguests in re:route..). hope you have a good time here!</p>


	<p>next day we have a meeting with Gi and Alessandra, the Big architects…we show them all instaltions the bigguests need to have prepared until they come…and we talk about the plans they did for the stage and the forum we outlined. there are some changes we have to do…they work fast, the next morning we see the new plan, now its okay.</p>


	<p>we have meetings with meetings. with the people from <span class="caps">BIG</span> school, who meet to elaborate a co-programm for/with the schools….with Cliomedia, who meet the org.tean to present a layout for a CD they&#8217;re going to do before Big…interesting meetings, some ideas get born, some decisions taken, but we can&#8217;t really concentrate on that now. in You we trust.</p>


	<p>and we meet Nico and <span class="caps">BELLISSIMO</span> to talk about the catalogues. Elka and Camilla are in <span class="caps">BELLISSIMOS</span> team now. that&#8217;s good! Luca proposes thrilled to call the mag&#8217;s <span class="caps">TOOBIG</span>&#8230; Nico comes up with a good idea &#8211; to send to all artists and to all people from the staff the same questions and to use that material later as the data/infobase for the first mag&#8217;…and to use apart from this material images form the town, many many images, no art, naked city. the mag&#8217; before &#8211; the city before… we think this can work very well… Teresa proposes to add this questionaire and the answers also into the project pool. yes, we do that!</p></div>

	<p>but now we are leaving to switzerland for three days. we have to meet Lisi Hämmerle in her gallery to prepare the orange-prints for Katrin, and we want to see Teresas family. Martin and Bettina and Malina from www.novaron.ch invite us for dinner… what a dinner! we see a new project novaron did, like it a lot.</p>


	<p>L°°ks calls us: they decided where to build the new bridge which will free Navia from the heavy traffic:</p>


	<p>puente_LA
56Kb</p>


	<p>between the paper-factory and us! we remember when we first heard of the bridge-project, 11 years ago, and Rudolf Sagmeister from the <span class="caps">KUB</span>, Bregenz saying that we can open a gas station then. with restaurant…now gonna build this bridge. we&#8217;re going to have a 1000 meter long, up to 38 meter high bridge in our windows in four years! will this be bad? interesting? we don&#8217;t know.</p>


	<p>but now T&#8217;n o are already back in Biella where they have some meetings concerning <span class="caps">UNIDEE 2002</span> and the programm for this summer. we&#8217;ll be present and active again in July and Oktober. in april we&#8217;ll be part of the jury again who chooses the people and projects for <span class="caps">UNIDEE</span>…we&#8217;d like to stay all three unidee-months, but we have to focus more on L.A. again and bring some ideas further in august, september.</p>


	<p>next day we make a big round trip all around the Piemonte with Mala and Michelangelo…we see some terrible places and spaces, renovated to the death and some nice ones…we need to have ideas what we gonna do with these spaces during <span class="caps">BIG</span>…maybe we&#8217;ll show videoworks from people we have downtown?…lets review all projects and think/talk about.</p>


	<p>next day, the last day we&#8217;re in cittadellarte, we get a visit from Marion Damiani, a friend/curator from Bolzano and the artis Hans Winkler from Berlin/New York. Hans tells us that he just was bathing Lady Liberty in <span class="caps">NYC</span> in a red glow of light.
now they are organizing an art-part during a traditional viallage fair in Brixen…and ask if we want to be part of it…we&#8217;d like to, but no time at all. we don&#8217;t want to become workingmashineartists, but import stronger rhythm and time-consistence of L.A. to our projects.</p>


	<p>that&#8217;s also why we have to go back home now…see you all in march. take care! specially you Cristiana with your sweet big belly….;))</p>


	<p>31st of Jannuary &#8211; we are leaving in direction home. first we stay two days again in Menton…chinese restaurant (Armona, Paolo and Ginevra are coming tomorrow!) and sleep in these fine beds in Hotel Aiglon. theres a village party in Menton now: la Fete du Citron. they have built all kind of kitschy orange/lemon sculptures in the city-park and ask for 20 Euros to enter! we prefer to see only parts from outside. and spend the money for the chinese food and the Thai beer.</p>

	<p>walking. reading. sleeping. letting the last 10 days drop… tomorrow we&#8217;ll drive to Biarritz and stay another night. this route is already something like a working/living route for us. some restaurants we consider as offices, some hotels as studios. some gasstations as bars…</p>


	<p>and again we wonder about that gigantic empty factory near Santader city. so much not-used space! all artists from the cantabrian coast could life&#8217;n work here. but there are also gigantic speculations going on we suppose. maybe you know more about it?</p>

	<p>3rd of February &#8211; back in mothership! L°°ks, Märle and Curt are awaiting us! the next weeks we want to concentrate in going on to making the sleepinghouse better, on bigguests projects and on our meeting in Madrid. we work a lot, but with calmness. that&#8217;s one of the good things down here: time/space is wider, nothing really happens, so you can see better what actually should happen.</p>


	<p>in the mornings we run again around the lake on Navias beach. we missed this body-hour a lot. when we&#8217;ll work in Turin for some months soon we have to get some old bikes at least&#8230;its so un- healthy to life just in the head and in fingertips.</p>


	<p>reading an article from Eduardo Kac and his transgenetic Bunny Alba. we like how and what he writes. didn&#8217;t know that he&#8217;s a kind of sister in mind. its raining tonight like never before! or is it because we&#8217;re sleeping now in the egg? only a thin cotton skin seperates us from the outside. raindrops on the sleeping house sound like falling music. each segment of the oval sounds different. the form doesn&#8217;t give any resistance to the wind, we only hear the dancing green noise of the pine trees, the laurel, the cherry tree, and the rain..</p>


	<p>we are doing banners and tons of mails and we talk about what we&#8217;d like to write for bigguest &#8211; related. we understand our work for Big much more than our project. we are curators, but don&#8217;t know what that is. we have to invent our own version. to communicate with some of the people we invited its like talking to somebody very close already. like we are working or living together. but with others its really resinous…but that&#8217;s big-life, we know why we&#8217;re doing that.</p>


	<p>Mama Pipi&#8217;s and Papa Balz&#8217;s baby comes to earth! a special welcome to <span class="caps">HIMALAYA YUJI ANSGAR</span>! soon the three will leave to the other L.A., California. maybe we&#8217;ll come to visit you if we go to Colombia with Juan…</p>


	<p>Potscholo does some great drawers for under our bed. we found ideas how to store all our stuff (cloths, suitcases,…) under the floor and under the bed. so the whole shape will remain open. L°°ks installs more lights and we put a big table into the entrence, uptrance…</p>


	<p>Madrid &#8211; <span class="caps">ARCO</span>. we have to prepare our speech for the panel discussion. what shall we say within a round which is invited because <span class="caps">THE DILEMMA OF THE EXHIBITING SPACE</span> [ARCHITECTURE <span class="caps">FOR ART</span>]? we will talk about calc, why we are and where, what we do and don&#8217;t. then we&#8217;ll show some projects &#8211; TIMEcloud, a park for L.A. and the ideas for the <span class="caps">BIG</span> hall… in order to make clear that its more about the dilemma of the atiitude of art(ists), not primary a problem of new spaces. we think that&#8217;s a good idea.</p>


	<p>4 days madrid. we visit <span class="caps">ARCO</span> and we visit <span class="caps">IKEA</span>. the panel is good. we&#8217;re surprised that we (Tony Fretton, Adam Caruso and Arie Graafland) agree on the the not-primary-problem of architecture, but arttitude. Key Portilla-Kawamura is a great host! him and the others he invited were very worth to come her! but it&#8217;s a pitty that Arco isn&#8217;t really interested in leting people profound their meeting and maybe generate some new ideas and informations. when we all made our presentation and we want to open the talk to the public they tell us that its time to go! 15 minutes of hyperhand- shaking with everybody, cursing, leaving. downtown with all the other panelsurfers…</p>


	<p>hours later, diving in the cigarette clouds of the after-opening-party we make a DJ-exchange-deal with Key&#8217;s friend Francisco &#8211; a CD- ping-pong for a year, continuous copy-send &#8211; copy-back communication to inform us about what we consider good music. heads or tails? heads &#8211; Francisco starts. but beside that and the presence of Consol Rodriguez (we know/ love us from <span class="caps">UNIDEE</span>..) it&#8217;s a arty farty lets-get-drunk-party. not too good. like theres nothing better to provoce than hangovers and other repetitions. the dinner with Consol the next night is much better!</p>


	<p><span class="caps">IKEA</span> was similar as <span class="caps">ARCO</span>, a lot of stuff in open boxes, from the white cube to the blue cube. but here we can at least afford something. we buy a closet.</p>


	<p>our favorite open box in <span class="caps">ARCO</span> was <span class="caps">ITURRALDE GALLERY</span> from L.A., California and the work of Gustavo Artigas: <span class="caps">DUPLEX</span>. no link found…strange…you know where&#8217;s one? we mention that because we&#8217;ve been invited to write about our &#8220;favorite work&#8221; for <span class="caps">ARCO</span>-noticias…we didn&#8217;t want, but then we wanted…</p></div>

	<p>before we had our talks today we went with Key to listen to another one: <span class="caps">HARD AND SOFT</span>: ART &#38; <span class="caps">ARCHITECTURE</span>. Ada Tolla and Giuseppe Lignano from <span class="caps">LOT</span>/EK, <span class="caps">NYC</span>, show very interesting transforming-space-projects, but all these projects have &#8220;weak contexts&#8221;, well not all, okay, but they are all pretty designish.</p>


	<p>and another special welcome! <span class="caps">KAYA TERESA</span> reaches saftly and soflty the earth! Mama Annette and Babba Stefan are telling us! soon we&#8217;ll meet each other in little Big Torino!</p>


	<p>april in february. its raining through the sun. got colder again, not easy in the sleepinghouse without any isolation…we have to talk to Martin (novaron) and about the <span class="caps">NASA</span>-stuff they used to isolate their new office-building…thermo-ceramics or something…</p>


	<p>Märle, Curt, Teresa and omi drive to Coruña. rainsun again. but warmer today. we want to see C because of a Verner Panton retrospective and to visit the lighthouse. we like Verner and Verner likes us!</p>

	<p>we think about to hang chairs into the sleepinghouse&#8230;for the second nose of the oval…when we see a hang chair study of Panton. statically it&#8217;s the same and aesthetically it could fit the form and form the fit.</p>

	<p>the lighthouse is fantastic. like really to give sign at the end of the world to those who went over the edge. a sculpture of a very early rocket dream. church shaped. have a view from this rocket: http://www.lavozdegalicia.com/galicia360/pelicula.jsp?foto=3</p>


	<p>we&#8217;re working on the text for bigguest.net &#8211; related…its so hard to say something clear and honest and not boring nor pathetic. after some days we stop. we have it. do we? we have to send it urgently to the translator if we want to have it italian/english. we invited all bigguests to write something. and we&#8217;re surprised &#8211; almost everybody wants to also reflect with words!</p>


	<p>finally we find a day to repair the &#8220;rain nose&#8221; of the sleepinghouse. what day is today? the 4th of March already! we have so much to do before to go to Turin! o! and we have to write for this arco_noticias_thing the text about Iturralde Gallery and Gustavo Artiga: <span class="caps">DUPLEX</span>. its easy. we liked the work, a video from G.A. from a perfomance he just did in the Fondazióne Telefónica in Madrid within this fair-trade-vanity circus a refreshing projection onto egotrippin&#8217; world. if you want to read the spanish text (104Kb) &#8211; we wrote?</p>


	<p>iturralde_artigas</p>


	<p>finally we can put the staircase-zinc-plate-covering for the sleepinghouse. it never looked so finished.</p>


	<p>…
we get asked from Casimiro, the man who runs the office where we insured Casqueiro, if we want to do propose a &#8220;similar concept&#8221; for Caridad as we proposed for Navia . this concept for Navia never was realized, while they were thinking about in which range they want to apply our idea the supermarket got built…but in Caridad it would be anyway not against some big buissnes, but in order to promote the small trades. well, we won&#8217;t have time until June, but then we&#8217;ll meet the people from Caridad…we never know what..</p>


	<p>works fulfullfull of digidigidigi and hanging on the phone. www.bigguest.net has to be half filled until the end of march. it rains a lot these days, like god doesn&#8217;t want us to go to the beach, but surf at home.
tomorrow Teresa and omi will leave to Turin again…until the end of may…now its getting really serious…in a bit more than a month we have to be ready for the big welcome.. check out www.bigtorino.net and www.bigguest.net. see you in June.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>Sislej Xhafa (Job Centre) and his wife arrive from <span class="caps">NYC</span>..they already started to build the wall for his installation..right next to the university.. Andreja Kuluncic (distributive justice) got her furnitures today, look great, really good done…we are happy &#8216;bout that..Andreja and Igor start to set up things..they arrived yesterday..bellissimo presents the stickers we wanted to have already 3 monthsago…for what they serve now?? we have to cut the installation from <span class="caps">ARTLAB</span> (Internal cinema &#8211; Project for Prisoners)..one meter too high..also the <span class="caps">MANAVA</span> (afterall.tv) space we have to redo..the acoustic insulation panels were not fixed like they wanted..Michelangelo shows up today…good!..he can make some fire under some asses..</p>


	<p>Manava sends the <span class="caps">URL</span> from their new website..next day, 17th already.. Fran Ilich (modem drama) arrives from Mexico..he brings Tequila.. about 10 more artists come today..Fran starts to work right away on the website for Modem Drama..after talking to Fran all our doubts regarding his project are gone..we didn&#8217;t have a good wire the last months..now things look much brighter..we&#8217;re looking forward to see the Modem Drama the first time..lunch break…does this look like we open in 2 days?</p>


	<p>30Kb</p>


	<p>thank&#8217;s God, you sent Lorenzo…really..what we&#8217;d do without this man? that&#8217;s the way everybody should work: trying to make the best out of the possibilities..but too much people loosing time/energy in complaining and comparing with better situations. didn&#8217;t we say its a big social game? why do so many think it&#8217;s just a big show? this is, first of all, a high risk..where 99% of the projects are proccesses, 99% are written in the sky..anyway in two days we have to touch down!</p>


	<p>Hans Op de Beeck (Border) is here now too! Colectivo Cambalache understands the big social game in their best sense: they organize parties every night..on night in Bar Amantes, the next one on a square..the people from FoAM Organisation (TxOom) are worried, their very complex and technical installation never will be ready for the opening..Maia and friends are confident, although nothings ready.. they are now painting the logicaland-worldmap on the floor..</p>


	<p>22Kb</p>


	<p>welcome Fayaz Jafri (Violence the surrogate for sex An animated movie)..how was your flight? pitty u can&#8217;t stay longer..</p>


	<p>what day? o the 18th already..now almost all artists are her and working on their things..everybody thinks his problems are the the most important ones, so we have around 200 most important problems and some others, but..God knows why, we (the hardcore- team: Judith, Teresa, omi) still feel confident and good..stressed and worried for a million of things..but fine&#8230;Charlotte Cullinan from <span class="caps">ARTLAB</span>, London arrived…Janine unfortunately couldn&#8217;t come..in bed with fever..Charlotte starts to finish their cinema installation..</p>


	<p>big troubles with Everyone is an Expert..they show us what we didn&#8217;t know &#8211; 1000&#8217;s of newspapers and stickers they printed with a headline saying &#8220;Basta Berlusconi, Bossi, Fini, benvenuti Clandestini&#8221;..big discussions, also with a lot of other artists about the problem of political provocation. we don&#8217;t like to have this cheap hammer in the media-foreground…all other projects would be ignored..our argument why we would skip this sentence from everywhere: its not wise to say &#8220;Basta..&#8221; and in the next moment to invite imigrants..which imigrant wants to be first identified with a &#8220;critic&#8221; against the government and then to inscribe him/herself into a public database? we discuss hours and hours…finally we leave it open to them and say: we saw these publications the first time now, would you have shown us when we were selecting things, we would have then criticized it..no the project itself, but what you want to put as a slogan over the idea..now, you change this sentence, like for instance say just &#8220;benvenuti clandestini!&#8221; or you decide to leave the frame of the biennial.
beside that we find the &#8220;Basta..&#8221; idea artistically flat and politally unwise, we see that the directors of the biennial are much more worried..&#8221;why putting oil on the fire of the right wing; they only wait for a cheap provocation like that offend us..&#8221; 
..we all liked the project expertbase a lot..we worked for it a lot… but Everyone is an Expert decides not to change anything and leaves..</p>


	<p>what did we learn? did we learn what since then rTMark and Everyone is an Expert is spreading? that we are in &#8220;a climate of fear and fascism&#8221; or we see that artists understand more about politics than activists about art? or simply that this isn&#8217;t Germany, this isn&#8217;t America..and it wasn&#8217;t..even before Berlusconi.. free speach in danger? have a look to the other ~120 projects.. and write an e-mail if you want to discuss this or any other mentioned problem directly with us.</p>


	<p>regarding the rTMark problem with their karaoke project we don&#8217;t want to loose any words here &#8211; their half-truths can be reat on their website..if somebody doesn&#8217;t now to differentiate a <span class="caps">LAW</span> from a <span class="caps">CENSORSHIP</span> it must be because the hype is more important than communication.</p>


	<p>heyyy! ciao Faisal Abdu&#8217;Allah (Garden of Eden), good to see you again..hope you feel well in Torino! your halfmirrorspaces are awaiting you already..Maria will help you..c u bro..</p>

Tal also will be part again of Arte Al Centro 2002..see u in Biella again..in July! take care!</p>

	<p>that means that the network worked..not mainly the plugdependent one, but the bloodependent..we are in touch..and we touched a lot which will draw new emerging patterns of paths..we are even playing with the idea to move our mothership to italy..</p>


	<p>lunch with Martin &#8216;Swami&#8217; Roth..the city showed interest in bying the fotobots..now this interest looks weird..but we have better things to talk about..&#8217;why not&#8217; says Martin &#8216;why not elaborating together a concept for a summer show in Zürich..at the sea.. you know this ideas of the mobile mind and house..&#8217; sounds like another fruit of the digital big tree..we&#8217;ll see..we&#8217;ll ping-pong..we&#8217;ll let you know..</p>


	<p>Martin flies to the californian L.A. in some days..with Monica..to see Pips and Balz and Yuji..and to show his belly on venice beach..hear you in some weeks.. see u more often..touching the nomads!</p>

chico come back!</p>


	<p>restart calc.yes..de- and repluging the mothership in 2000 km distance..would we do it again with a house and houses? or mobile..only mobile systems, some SUSIs and we could start..we are playing with the idea.. very strongly..talking to l°°ks, maleX and Curt and Märle about it..so many reasons are indicating that we should bring the mothership physically closer to where some very good friends and projects are living..our L.A.life is to maybe 70% made out of net..the electronic one.. its like the question if we want to change from the virtual to the physical network..and if the L.A. model is over..not over..starting an new phase of reality..we feel like the extraterrestrials il turinesi waited for..c the next chapter of the c-diary..august. we&#8217;ll have more to say.. how many times we will postpone our journey to L.A.? ..we&#8217;ll stay some more days, you know..want to have more time with Judith..work together with her and with bellissimo..on the magazine -TOOBIG#2..and maybe do a little research on empty spaces and possibilities to set up a laboratory here in Torino..maybe just a small sisterlab..two places? have to talk to l°°ks soon.. a lot!</p>


	<p>it&#8217;s the 25th of May today..6 days after the big basta.. ..sunny, cloudy..nervous day in the sky..eating salat somewhere..Teresa, Judith, omi..talking about the strange ways how love can change a lot…salat.. and the <span class="caps">BIG</span>-files..not easy..not easy..#2..going to bellissimo a lot, like the good, the bad and the ugly.. but we&#8217;re not really making impression on the graphi/design-..not to mention the content/context- team spirit..no layout until 10 days before going to the typographer..air out, shoes wet, time gone, all we can do now is helping them finding all the material together..one week..we stay some more days..and maybe the bellissimi sleeping beauties wake up when we stand in the door every day..and understand that this is first for the artists..and for all who did <span class="caps">BIG</span>.. we&#8217;re regenerating energies..still at the salatplace.. Teresa, Judith, omi..Judith saying the first time that <span class="caps">S H E  W A N T S  T O  B E  P A R T  O F  C A L C</span> ! what a veryvery good idea! T&#8217;n o can imagine well going on..telling l°°ks, telling maleX..what a wish!..</p>


	<p>we work since a half year..longer..together..ma dei! Judith..&#8217;lets fete&#8217;! another round of wine..grignolino.. going on with even the same new-re-start place, qua?..lets decide with l°°ks and also maleX about, but we&#8217;re sure they&#8217;ll love you as much as we do!
.. .
its amazing how fast big got masticated..going through cavellrizzas yard now, full of cars, closed spaces..feels like steping from a Fellini into a Tarkovskj movie..from la fiesta to a la nostalgia..</p>


	<p>filling content with Luca bellissimo into colored pages.. writing mails and calling around..material, give us your material about your work at big..we better stay some more days..Dominic, Jakob, Ola, Kaisa, Lorenzo..Maria ..Marie, all still around and busy..aperitivos..meeting the folks from 8081 and mister hell.com himself..ciao Ken Aronson..</p>


	<p>backyard office space..a lot of screens..changing some ideas..critics..views..Ken is partly transporting his life to Torino..decided, L.A. &lt;-&gt; Torino..we tell him that we come from L.A. too..Las Aceñas, donde hay flores y frutales, perros y vecinos..y mucha vida con dedos sobre las teclas..Casqueiro valley..&#8217;in the californian L.A. there is nothing like the aperitivos di Torino&#8217; say Ken..nor in the spanish L.A&#8230;only once a year..when we do the village party.. everybody cooks for everybody..</p>


	<p>looking~listening a lot to the island..telling Seba, Luca, and the other two..from 8081..that we&#8217;d like to show them our first concept for the big-guest-book..</p>


	<p>who knows, you know..we have the feeling there is something..el momento..tiene algo, saves..</p>


	<p>Torino! Stocolmo, Sevilla, Cadiz..and more cities, but we only found those..until now..and reasons to stay some more days..in the end we will have lived 3 months in Torino..feels like a year..its hard to go.. only some more days left and even we go..Judith will go to Havanna where her brother marries..Tanja.. en hora buena guapos! we&#8217;ll have about 8, 9 days when we arrive in L.A..nothing..much more than nothing..we wantwantwant to talk to l°°ks..our now and then..</p></div>

	<p>good to have this information..we have to scan this idea on all levels..Teresa and Judith went to see the immigration office..suburbs..an ex fair-hall..today cattle-hall..they want to ask for not-european..for example an armenian with a white USpassport..stateless..what possibilities he has apart from asking for political asylum? if for instance a company proofs that this man is professionally unique, can he get papers?..1000s of squaremeters of official Italia and nobody knows?? &#8216;okay&#8217; Teresa says &#8216;i&#8217;ll do a comparative visit in la policia estranjera in Luarca..why they are doing all that? we never can scan enough..</p>

	<p>but what are we doing? cittadellarte was flooded some days ago..rio Cervo went crazy bringing tons of rain from the mountains and climbing over the windows of the whole groundfloor..flooding the whole cellar, the performance space, the yard the kitchen the stores, the livingroom..tons of mud and stones everywhere..hundreds of objects, things, tools, works..under a mudflood..what a shok! a lot of people are working now on emtiing the spaces from the masses.. some are cleaned already..and one floor higher a &#8216;fair of art and production&#8217; gets prepared..build up..animo amigas! and grazie mille per setting things up for us..bye belli..bye bye..see you in two weeks..we&#8217;re back..to rock the residents!</p>

      <div class="body"><p>omi and L°°ks alone..when did this happen the last time? 4 years ago? five? how nice! we decide to take every days last sun-hours and go to the beach or somewhere else where we can talk undisturbed..about everything..
the we-question: our friendship and its sea..how are we? ..the c a l c question: what is it now, how we want it to go on? the Torino-question &#8211; how to run this baby-, if Casqueiro stays the mother-ship?
..and more basic &#8211; how can we make the structures lighter and stronger..?</p>


	<p>every day &#8211; the sandtalks..when Teresa arrives we can present her some new thoughts and proposals..</p>


	<p>Ian sends a mail.. . . ..
.. i like love because i have someone to talk to.
we too! Teresa calls from Corniglia and Carrara and Montepulcano and Napoli, from Torino and from Biella..and from wherever she calls she brings fresh wind into Casqueiros Mathau-Lemon culture.. soon she&#8217;ll be back..some days..</p>


	<p>days are blue und grey and blue..never really closed skies, always moving windy bluegrey..working half days in mamiship and hanging around into the evenings and nights on the beaches the other half of doris..sandbeaches, barbeaches, fiestabeaches.. bedbeaches..50:50 holidays and workidays..asturian august, we love you so much!</p>


	<p>Juan sends images! a house in the house..a new element hanging in an old structure..a ruin structure..you know these pre-ruins, who become ruins before they have been finished..dead structures, concrete-waiting to fall into the cycles of nature again..Juans model proposes to use these ruins as a supporting structure for interdependent structures..hook and life..</p>


	<p>35Kb</p>


	<p>omi proposes to do some simulations on digi-images he has made from these pre-ruins the last travelling years..he never knew for what, now it seems Juan found out..nos vemos pronto en Biella..lets photoshop! y besa la barriga mucho!</p>


	<p>Teresa is in Carrara now..they are visiting the quarry.. leaving to Napoli..we asturians are at the beach again..la Jira! Manolo is wearing a t-shirt saying <span class="caps">I LIKE NASTY GIRLS</span>..and his bar is full of them! god knows why, but today all harlots from all around are here..enjoying the music a DJ is mixing for hours and hours and hours &#8211; M.Pol &#8211; house..jazz..funk.. james-bond-soul..queek-hop..</p>


	<p>M-Pol, Josè, Cajero, Luis Angel,Charly, M-Pol, Bego, L°°ks sharing sound&#8217;n sidrashowers (72Kb)</p>


	<p>Paco and Jenny have a bar now..a club!..good sound system, a lot of space to dance..L°°ks introduces himself as omis manager.. and decides with Paco a dance-night on the 24th..L°°ks manages omi &gt; the DJ..nobody knew, exept the manager..some careers are born in sparks of moments..we call this night <span class="caps">CURACION SEXUAL</span> (sexual healing..) and do a poster, which looks like &#8220;for a children- birthdayparty, with a dragqueen as the starguest..&#8221; (Beetli Scissorer).. but we have to do something direct, strange..otherwise no lazy ass shakes up..</p>

	<p><span class="caps">ART FUTURA 2002 31</span> of october &#8211; 3rd of november wants to show communimage..fast ping pong between all the calcis and: okay..we&#8217;ll do it…Roberta invited us.. the lady who came to Torino and wrote about bigguest we just heard that Mexico City doesn&#8217;t work..you remember? Rudolf Frieling from the <span class="caps">ZKM</span>-Karlsruhe asked us (he already curated the web-section during the Sao Paolo..) if we want to show a 1:1 print from communiamge in M.city…we would have loved to…everything was prepared..but after the chief curator gave up, because of some bad blood..god knows..we didn&#8217;t hear anything..and decided to forget about it..when they&#8217;ll call today it will be too late to produce the print..but anyway, viva mejico cabrones!</p>


	<p>and &#8211; while Teresa receives the invitation from Roberta, the calcis back home in the greenland receive an invitation to partizipate in the 2nd biennial of Buenos Aires &#8211; Argentina… they want us to come during th 7th and the 10th of november to give a 40 min. lecture..talking about our work..during the &#8220;Journées de la Critique&#8221;..and to &#8220;to bring along some of your works to exhibit during the Second Biennial&#8221;..doesn&#8217;t sound too serious..well..lets ask them some questions and see how things develop..we can imagine they have it very stresed and dificult over there..we&#8217;d like to do a project on B.A. ahora..</p>


	<p>what about our restart-calc-plans? the sandtalks? &#8216;bit sanded..more and more work for parkparty#4 has to be done..but L°°ks and omi are on the beach again, this beach:</p>


	<p>127Kb</p>


	<p>well, what gets clearer every day is that we&#8217;d like to run two studios..or labs..or ships..the L.A.-ship and the Torino-ship Teresa receives a phonecall while she is visiting Napoli.. the chief of Torinos Patrimonio calls to give us a date to meet him..we wrote him explaining our situation and wish to have some factory space in Torino. on the 12th of Sept. we can meet him..hope he can offer somehting interesting. the best would be to find something already this year..some projects (like the one we started with Martin Roth) we want to develop in Torino..we&#8217;ll see..you&#8217;ll see..now all depends if we can find a low budget space..looow..</p>


	<p>the sandtalks are fine. although we can&#8217;t find the solutions we&#8217;re getting closer to them..clearer now..L°°ks will be the mothership manager and T&#8217;n o&#8217;n Judith will be the sistership and in-between-manager..how to pay the two studios? don&#8217;t know..but we&#8217;ll find ways..slow budget..slooow..</p>


	<p>but now Anis comes!! 22-08-2002 &gt;
A n i s i s b o r n !
the doughter of Cristina and Juan!
congratulations, bienvenido al mundo,
queremos ser tus ti@s buen@s, Anis!</p></div>

La Drogheria is omis office now, Judith passes by! we talk about all the projects we want to do.. soon..here in Torino..but where? we check newspapers and go to see a huge flat..corso dante..around the corner, near the Po..good flat, mama mia, what a flat! but strange vibes and too much money, much too much..lets take time and find something in the months we are here..Judith got an offer from a gallery..if she wants to come to the artfair in Berlin..a week..helping presenting..selling..she accepts. Galleria <span class="caps">MAZE</span> (forgive them this web-site, soon a digipixy will have kissed it!), via Mazzini..the gallerists also run La Drogheria..the bar-restaurant-living-room-office we&#8217;re sitting right now..the world is small and the web is physical!</p>

	<p>L°°ks spends last days with Malex and Salome, the two hot scientists! they&#8217;re lo(ugh)ving now in the sleepinghouse.. september becomes more and more spring and summer.. skies are bluer everyday. tomorrow M and S will leave.. back to Zürich..after they will have visited Gherytown.. and Teresa was starting her journey yesterday..see you in some days in cittadellarte miss president..</p>


	<p>o, we never saw this link..until now, end of long and crazy august…the transnational republicans talking about their first visit to Torino..checking out the possibilities for their <span class="caps">BIG</span>-pavilion..long time ago..again we realize what fruits the <span class="caps">BIG</span> social game generated..even a babyship! and aM <span class="caps">A Z</span> Eing perspectives..and for you? any news, all you mute artists out there?? any BIGfruit to link?</p>


	<p>btw bigfruit!&gt; omi meets Lorenzo at the beach°..they talk about this idea of sharing a space..first Judith and omi are going to meet people from the city..see if they are interested in helping us..leting us an empty factory.. a flat..any backyard house..and then we can become more concrete…but Lorenzo likes the idea..chevidiamo..</p>


	<p>the beach° is getting everytime more expensive and tieland.. music&#8217;s okay so far..deep funkycolical afternoontunes mixed with the sweet and spicy smell of campingkebab from our marrocan neighbours..river Po running slow..while Teresa, Laia and David staring aqueous at the cheese trolley in a two-star-gran-nacion-establisment near Toulouse..L°°ks, back in sundown country, is watching the waves being sync- hronized with the moods of the nights..</p>


	<p>omi meets Maria again! they have a great dinner and wave too..eating the half night..and restart possible colaborations..shall we do the visuals for livingrooms together? but it got quite quiet from Martins direction.. although he sent images where we maybe could install the livingrooms..middle of zürich..Platzspitz..the needle- park..exneedle, now only fir needles..</p>

	<p>and Martin wants to move to London for some months.. learn to edit videos..we don&#8217;t think that 2004 is a realistic date to present livingrooms..but anyway, lets work on the research and some visuals to give an idea how this &#8220;cityvillage&#8221; will look like…from all sides we hear that other groups and curators are planning similar things… kind of cityvillages..where artists invent spaces and proportions, relations and approaches to socialspacial problems..questions..also <span class="caps">MAZE</span> is working on something like that..but <span class="caps">TOP</span> secret you know ..and a spanish curator writes, telling us from the &#8220;village&#8221; he wants to to set up in south spain and if we want..more..some paragraphs beneath..</p>


	<p>10th of september..omi arrived yesterday, Teresa, Laia and David today..welcome back in cittadellarte..all the other a.i.r. are already here..different music is playing from different corners of the studio..indian..portuguese.. israelian e-beat (subsonics)..middle of September…</p>


	<p>while we are getting more and more liquid sweating in the tasks with the a.i.r. we receive an invitation from gokArt to do a project &#8220;in&#8221; Bolzano…the invitation comes from Marion P. Damiani…you remember? she invited us many years ago to join the cartografia show.. and then again for <span class="caps">GET TOGETHER</span> in Vienna…it was always fine to work with her, so we decide to think/talk about it and give her a feedback until the end of the month…there are some ideas around wich we&#8217;d like to profound.. Teresa came up with it..it all evolved from the &#8220;lowcator&#8221;.. the tool/surface we want to realize since years.. where a worldmap can be informed with own moves and stops and links..working title:geographia affectiva… we let you know if these terms generated more flesh..</p>

	<p>Juan asked Teresa if she wants to give an interview regarding the new Project we started &gt; <span class="caps">GEOGRAFIA AFFECTIVA</span> &lt; Teresa asked all the a.i.r. and some other people how they define these terms, at 12:00 she&#8217;ll read all the answers mixed with road- sounds Juan collected…slowly WE&#8217;re getting closer to this idea..</p>


	<p>the unidee-days and nights are full! as every year people are getting more and more bbbusy.. as nearer the presentation day comes as longer the nights are..we like this time..when things finally overflow, swashing into the real, into the tangible.. danceble..check the u-diary and later on the website of <span class="caps">UNIDEE2002</span>..guess we&#8217;re going to
do it eventually in nov./dec..</p>


	<p>today we got an invitation to &#8216;we&#8217;ll-see&#8217; from
Tomàs Ruiz Rivas,
http://www.geocities.com/ojo_atomico/ingles/einicio.html
an autonomous curator from Madrid…he&#8217;s planning &#8220;something similar&#8221; to livingrooms…well, at least that he wants to relate &#8220;architecture&#8221; to a social/cultural context..and more..we write back that we&#8217;re interested but need to know more about..we receive the link to <span class="caps">VERA03</span>, where the concept is explained.. we like it, but its so supersoon, end of april 2003 it starts already.. hmm, we really would like to work in Vera&gt;..but what can we develop in such a short time?..lets meet when we&#8217;re back in L.A. and see what we
can do..together..</p>


	<p>Teresa and omi are working beside the <span class="caps">UNIDEE</span>-tasks on the web-site for Amigo Eytan Shoukers project &gt; disposable-eyes ..he and his partner Eldad Cidor are presenting together with a project from Suzanna Lauterbach..very soon in the jewish museum in Berlin…after a very intensive week, diving through a pile of CD&#8217;s, images and texts disposable-eyes goes online! we do a simple translation of the catalogue-layout..and some
tiny little surprises..</p>


	<p>some weeks ago we sent Eytan the first rough concept for Y-land, remember? its this communimage-similar project, specially thought and made for middle-east Ip-numbers, resp. for palestinians and israelians..a worldwide middleast play..omi talks with Liron (a.i.r) about it..Eytan said that he&#8217;d like to introduce the interface in all P- and
I -schools..sounds like a naiv dream today, doesn&#8217;t it? but Liron likes to cooperate! IF we can do it we do it somehow together.. we will do this project, no matter when and how..but as soon as possible.. and then we can unfold it in front of your eyes..
lets find money..a lot please.!</p>


	<p>we think that especially in times like this a play like this can give a good input. first because there are (still) so many good wills on both sides (the people who don&#8217;t make it into the mass- media..) and second because we don&#8217;t know it before we tried.</p></div>

	<p>this years <span class="caps">ARTE AL CENTRO</span> show <span class="caps">THE NEW AGORA</span> , curated by Dagmar Reichert, will go after Biella to Zuerich &gt; Shedhalle…Dagmar writes us to ask if we wanna do a workshop during the show..somewhen in february 2003.. yes, sure, we&#8217;d like to…we&#8217;d like also to see Zürich again, meet friends (the fisslegang®, Anja Maissen!) and first of all to try to do some steps with Martin Swami Roth towards livingrooms..or towards a better decision..howegonbro?</p>


	<p>Liron Theresaseainjerusalem Meshulam (a.i.r.) tells us about the plans to bring <span class="caps">ALL A</span>.I.R. from the last 4 years to Jerusalem..to intervene in the city..together with about 20 artists from Israel and Palestine.. Liron also talks with Michelangelo about it, he sees it as we do: as an important thing to do! Liron will contact to one of her professors &#8211; if he wants to help making it true as well, it really could happen in 2003! can we maybe do something in the Mamila Pool?? &#8221;..reserved for c a l c ;-)&#8221; says Liron..</p>


	<p>18.10 -&gt; omi and Judith would like to go to Bergamo.. following Ciacintos invitation to do a project in &#8220;his&#8221; museum..but we can&#8217;t come the day we said, because he&#8217;s coming..to cittadellarte..
doing a project with Michelangelo..and a Renault car..fotographers..a guy holding a silver sheet to provoce a bit suneffect.. almost no time for nothing..nobody, only: we visit you in Bergamo Ciacinto..in winter..with a little surprise!</p>


	<p>Liron just finished her website for there is a sea in jerusalem …she did it very quick because she wanted to have it online before the 26th is coming…when the a.i.r. presentations are.. why don&#8217;t you
do a seapiece for Jerusalem? how? well..
moment, I&#8217;ll ask Liron..</p>


	<p>and Bryan too..made his first web-site the last days..he was working with Teresa on programming <span class="caps">PARADIGM ISLAND</span> have a look, have a cook..tell the artist what art he should do/be..do-be or not do-be&#8230;btw. doubies, Bryan is a strict <span class="caps">NON</span>-SMOKER. so don&#8217;t tell him that he has to get stoned after having lunch and before la siesta!</p>


	<p>btw.btw&#8217;s &gt;&gt; strange! that we don&#8217;t talk  f i r s t  o f  a l l  from the a.i.r.! no doubt, that = what we live and are and do most! now. but beside that, like more or less civilised butterflies, there are other things flying &#8216;round, landing, taking off.. ex/imploding..and we also don&#8217;t have so much time for that typetype here.. this was always thought as a sraightsimple reminder..feedbacker.. netmaker..lookforwarder..over cover agenda..so its theoretical enough to add the most actual a.i.r.link and then just talk about the buttersaucers..an later we hopefully can conclude the whole website together..</p>


	<p>we&#8217;re talking to Armano and Paolo about their flat
in Torino, and offer a sum we could pay every month..for one year.. hey, they think about it..maybe this will work out!</p>


	<p>last weekend there was the <span class="caps">MINIMUM PRIZE</span> selection..PETTEK won! Tal Adler and his lets-run-to-the-parlament-project, &gt;great,gratulazione! ..hope this award helps to make PETTEKs future closer..</p>


	<p>and we saw Slivy and Yannick again…remember? they are the one who run the bureau de competence e desirs in Marseille…they tell us that they gonna do now also a project room where artists can play&#8217;n stay and develop a work..they invite us..we&#8217;ll visit them in January, when we already will life&#8217;n work in Torino…5 hours by car..right in the middle of Mothership and Babyship..this spacial fact could inspire what we wanna do.. a middleknot..a knottlemid..</p>

	<p>one fire left

	<p>ciao all fresh a.i.r. c you lets keep in touch..</p>


	<p>omi&#8217;s leaving to London..to Edinbourgh..Goldsmiths, Protoacademy..Teresa to Barcelona.. architecture.. architects.. L°°ks back in L.A., since 2 months living with Märle and Curt.. they bought a lawnmower ! Tarzan is a lawnmower in the end. in two hours they can have all Casqueiro shaved..they say..</p>


	<p>London ! Maria ! Tom ! Aaanjuschka ! and Simon, Ola, Kajsa, Lyn &#38; Lyn, Consol, Joe, Key, Janine, Bernie, Paolo (ARTLABs assistent, studying here !), Gavin, Miss Rogoff..Goldsmiths &gt; the department for historical and cultural studies invited c a l c omi..entering, brickbuilding, symetric, very huffy concierge..in the entrance posters for an anti-war-against-iraq-demonstration &gt; today..now ! it stoped raining, lets have a guiness before the talk.. good guiness &gt; c a l c, why it started, where it went, how it goes, what we&#8217;ll do next. good talk ! this is an open round with an open question. what art are you (doing) ? later in the bar, crowded with guinessing artstudents..lets talk about you and me, lets talk about art baby, lets talk about all the good things and the bad things that could be..good to be here, welcome at home.</p>


	<p>Edingbourgh..long trainride..a lot of ties..rules and recommendations..now get up and wash your hands says a sign over the mirror in the toilet..a Daily Sun is laying around..the ex-butler of lady Di saw terrible things going on in the palace, Charles knows much more as he should and if he would talk about it the last he could become is king..this must be the only son in the world who waits wishfully until his mam dies..but right now he would be happier if the butler would have been gone forever..
God save the butler!</p>


	<p>looks a lot like Asturias here ..green juicehills, factories, stormy sky and sun..but light cliffs, not dark..Steve at the station ! zack and 2 hours later something similar like in London, little c a l c art(hi)story..but smaller, more quiete, no whats, buts and hows in the end. thanks for comming!</p>

	<p>Aya-a.i.r. came too! and Chris Byrne ! remember him ? he&#8217;s the one who invited us years ago to join little colaborative online-projects..now he&#8217;s the director of media scot..but in a rush..see you another time..guinessing at a pub, later to a indian vegetarian restaurant.. some yous, some mes.. windy here, reminds of Santiago de Compostela, all the stone, the moss..but Bonfire night tonight ! in memoriam Guy Fawkes, the angry parlamentbomber from 1605 (failed).. amazing how acts like Fawkes&#8217; can get a metaphorical tradition.. a traditional ritual..incredible light the next morning, silverblue day..the willows down at the harbour shimmer like the surface of a nervous lake..bye Edi, we&#8217;ll meet again.. thanks Steve and Karen for hosting the calci.. Steve Duval has the same Ikea bed-sofa as Tom Dale!</p>


	<p>back to London for 2 days&#8230;saying ciao and visiting again Tate Modern..why ? because of the bookshop..trying to find something on architecture and nomadism&#8230;but just evergreens and bestsellers here..like in the shows too, of course, what you expected ? we&#8217;ve seen better things from Herzog &#38; de Meuron..the light here &gt; you either need sunglasses or a torch. but the floor is special.. Beuys has a lot of it..today with discolights, really, the bulbs go crazy while we see &#8221; blitzschlag auf hirsch &#8221;, the basaltstones, the fine drawings of women and animals..bulb fiction ! twink-twink, we&#8217;re sure that some think thats part of the work. &#8221; it is. &#8221; Beuys would maybe say..</p>


	<p>anyway &gt; the best art we&#8217;ve seen was the
London Eye. not because they fixed 32 kind of sleepinghouses on an amazing wheel, but because its whole story, its fantastic engeneering, its superb estetics and its surprise for everybody, while for instance Anish Kapoor in the Tate surprises just the classical Disney-contemplation-clientele.. okay, there&#8217;s a huge aaaahh when you see it first, but after checking that its a big thing, nothing else, it gets boring, no ?</p>


	<p>or the Chapman brothers &gt; white cube (we don&#8217;t add the <span class="caps">URL</span>, you&#8217;d get a flash-headache..), they present well done pseudo african tribal sculptures with this ironical/critical touch&#8230;because some of the wooden sculptures contain Mc Donalds elements..the M..a tribal wooden Big Mac.. good black british voodoo humor.. and art for collectors and to tranquilize its own consciousness? shady relation between efford and output. why not plug in this &#8220;critic&#8221; into real life in a direct way ? because than its not art anymore, but social working, rendering of services? up to you what you want to change in your life..</p>


	<p>Tom Dale is good cook ! a good artist and a long range termdetecter..brings a catalogue from Newcastle (they left for the weekend..) from this danish guy, norwegian ? fck, forgot the name again..interesting artist! &#8216;saw the Mao and the Bob Hope demonstration? Tom, tell me, what was his name (may God rest his soul) ? later..now bye, byebye and c u in butlers county in April..April ? later..beneath..</p>

	<p>first we pack the suitcase for plug-in and the travelling curators-archive..and send it to Annette, who invited us some weeks ago ..</p>


	<p>its so strange to be back here…so quiete, we always fall into this workhole after the <span class="caps">UNIDEE</span>-months..after so much working with the a.i.r. it&#8217;s always difficult to realign ourselves. but that&#8217;s also the reason why its great to be back! all space and time wide&#8217;n bluegreen..</p>


	<p>Gernot sends the link to his new website &gt;&gt; realitylab &#8220;realitylab invetigates and develops new media-realities..&#8221; see also the article with the same title Gernot wrote for bigguest.net. we are happy to hear that planhaus, the architecture studio of Claudia and Gernot works well!</p>


	<p>Liron writes..an sends a first paper regarding the plan to invite about 70 artists (mainly ex-a.i.r.) to Jerusalem. she asks us if we want to be in the &#8220;artistic direction&#8221; of the project..together with her, Tal, Michelangelo and her favorite professor..okay, but we only can give you mail feedbacks..Liron says that she&#8217;s doing a little web-site with informations right now..we&#8217;ll be online very soon..</p>

	<p>another mail from amigo Nico Dockx..anouncing »new courious releases«: <span class="caps">CURIOUS</span>/releases is a small alternative label -publishing/production home based in Antwerpen of which its energy is generated through cooperation instead of competition &#8230; trying to build a self-structuring economy where the profits of one project subsidize the realization of the next &#8230;</p>


	<p>Teresa leaves to Sevilla for a week..she&#8217;ll visit David (ex-a.i.r.) and his architect-friends..maybe she&#8217;ll partizipate in an architecture competition.. our common works we&#8217;ll continue online..
c u in a week miss president!</p>


	<p>L°°ks and omi are working on the <span class="caps">BOO</span>©..and on preparing all the projects that we will start to develop between Torino and L.A..from cittadellarte we get the advice today that they don&#8217;t want us to do the <span class="caps">UNIDEE2002</span>-website…first they want to rethink this task and maybe find an internal solution..we hope that someone will do it soon! the next potential artists in residents will check the site and expect freshinfo from this year..</p>


	<p>Tomàs Ruiz Rivas calls..he wants to visit us next week to talk about our possible colaboration for <span class="caps">VERA03</span> &#8211; bienal de arte in situ..fine, welcome!</p>

	<p>good moment to do the babyship-step! we can&#8217;t say now how much time we&#8217;ll spend here in L.A. and there in Torino..maybe fifty-fifty like last years? or even more? we&#8217;ll see, it depends a lot of how we can manage the two places..we&#8217;re also playing with the idea to offer a residency in Casqueiro.. 2, 3 artists could come each year and investigate as an autonomous part of the infrasculpture.. we&#8217;ll let you know.. anyway &gt; c a l c, living and working in España and Italia!</p>


	<p>saturday, 30st of november, sundown at the green- coast…tomorrow we want to go online with the redesigned <span class="caps">BOO</span>© ! around the 15th of december Teresa and omi will leave to Torino again..Lººks mothershipping..Judith and Iris will life then already in babyship! as soon as we find time we will update this <span class="caps">BOO</span>© again..feb..</p>

	<p>funny and treffendes image..a lot reason to lough down here, a catastrophe a la olé! and to shout from anger &#8216;bout all this dirty dealers in all this dirty deals!! the only hope related to that desaster is that it brakes the political necks of some señoritos..</p>

	<p>the beaches and coasts more west and east from here are much more affected than ours..but what we&#8217;re talking about? little dirty coasts where some little dirty fishes die? here comes the real phish! http://www.stopesso.com/funstuff/nose.html
Malex found him in the net..do we just dream that or is this really the worst year since we are living?</p>


	<p>L°°ks is going to help to clean a beach..down to Freixulfe, where also other friends and neighbours are trying to do their best&#8230;what an ugly stuff this black oily shit! looks and smells like the gewissen of the dealers and politicians who are responsible for that!</p>


	<p>and while the world is going down the phone rings..its Casimiro, its about a little folder they want, el consejo de Franco..not a very inviting name to fold..what is it? a folder for the village, where all shops and bars and special things and roads are indicated, a tourist- guide to La Caridad, Viavelez and the other hicktowns..</p>


	<p>a look at the fridge and we agree &#8211; we&#8217;ll propose something for el Franco, the consejo..and we talk about euros and timetables..Casimiro tells that theres this amazing creche, biblical and regional and huge..in some days there will be the opening..the artist did some new scenes in the creche landscape..</p>

	<p>the apple was a present from Eva..from who else? O&#8217;s last sms was a big question: why don&#8217;t you come to L.A. for the new years dinner..and some more days..??</p>


	<p>tomorrow we&#8217;ll drive back to L.A.! Mala comes with us, perfect moment, time..maybe the newest year of all..! ciao sister Vernedi (= Iris..she found out that we&#8217;re the Adams family, she seems to be really happy to have &#8220;experienced&#8221; that), greet Napoli..Casino..Mamapapa..</p>

	<p>long way back home..</p>


	<p>Mala and omi are peepeeping a lot. sms is great, isn&#8217;t it? but muchmuch to expensive! where is the organisation who fights against telecoms price policy?? how can it be that these gangsters charge 80 cent for one intereuropean peep if it costs them near zero?? anyway, we have to, because Mala seems to fall in love with Luigi (who the fuck is…?) and omi seems to fall too..he flies in loVe..ay, que dias!</p>


	<p>and while the children are playing with their mobile phones and their friends on the other ends of the lines, Teresa and Topi are driving them all savely to L.A…where L°°ks is already doing old/new-year-dinner-plans..</p>


	<p>a night in a french village..Castelaudary..santa claus! we never know what it makes so strange in these french minicities..is it so silent? does it look like everybody left or will leave soon? but there is a nice documentary about synchron-swimmers in the hotel-tv..</p>

	<p>the calcis are working on the concept for Konstanz, while Topi is working on the question what type of company he should set up..
it&#8217;s the first time that we all are and work/play together in Casqueiro! its so good to have Mala here, finally! L.A. likes Mala and Mala likes L.A.! and omi can&#8217;t get eVa out of his mind..but..why should he? in few days she&#8217;s coming!</p>


	<p>the Konstanz-work goes very well! every day we take some hours and play with this idea to use the databank of the uni- versities library to generate with its search-keywords and -results a relational/visual landscape.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s the 29th of december &#8211; the real x-mas, at least for omi: eVa arrives today! by train from Sevilla..to Oviedo bienvenida en Asturias! que bueno que veniste de verdad! are you hungry, i am hungry, vamos al Vesuvio en Gijon..</p>
